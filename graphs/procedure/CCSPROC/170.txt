excision	is a	surgical procedure
excision	performed for	removal of skin lesion
excision	indicated for	benign skin lesion
excision	indicated for	malignant skin lesion
excision	yields	tissue specimen
excision	provides	pathology specimen
excision	requires	anesthesia
local anesthesia	used for	minor excision
general anesthesia	used for	extensive excision
excision	followed by	wound closure
incision	created by	excision
excision	results in	scar
scar	affects	cosmesis
excision	risk of	infection
excision	risk of	hematoma
excision	risk of	seroma
excision	risk of	wound dehiscence
excision	risk of	delayed healing
excision	risk of	scar formation
margin status	determined by	excision
negative margins	indicate	complete excision
positive margins	indicate	residual lesion
pathology	analyzes	specimen
pathology	confirms	diagnosis
diagnosis	informs	treatment plan
excision	used for	diagnostic biopsy
biopsy	provides	histology sample
histology	reveals	tumor type
tumor type	determines	prognosis
prognosis	influenced by	tumor type
tumor type	informs	adjuvant therapy decision
excision	influences	recurrence risk
recurrence risk	depends on	margins
recurrence	monitored by	follow-up
follow-up	includes	wound assessment
wound assessment	guides	wound care
wound care	affects	healing time
healing time	varies with	patient age
patient age	influences	scar quality
scar quality	affects	cosmetic outcome
cosmetic outcome	monitored by	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	influenced by	cosmetic outcome
postoperative infection	increases	hospital stay
postoperative infection	requires	antibiotics
antibiotics	used for	prophylaxis
drain	placed after	excision
drain	reduces	fluid accumulation
suture	closes	incision
incision	heals via	granulation
granulation	progresses to	scar tissue
lesion size	influences	excision extent
excision extent	determines	reconstruction method
defect size	guides	closure technique
closure technique	includes	primary closure
closure technique	includes	grafting
grafting	used for	large defects
large defects	require	flap coverage
flap coverage	achieves	tissue restoration
tissue restoration	aims for	functional outcome
functional outcome	affects	patient quality of life
seroma	may form	after excision
hematoma	may form	after excision
bleeding	controlled by	hemostasis
infection	delays	healing
healing	completes	wound closure
pathology report	delivered by	pathologist
adjuvant therapy	considered for	high-risk lesions
radiation therapy	used for	malignant skin lesion
chemotherapy	used for	metastatic skin cancer
targeted therapy	considered for	BRAF-positive melanoma
genetic testing	performed for	hereditary risk
risk assessment	informs	surgical planning
dermatopathology	studies	skin lesions
skin lesion	classified as	benign or malignant
benign lesion	treated with	excision
malignant lesion	treated with	excision
excision	followed by	pathology review
referral	occurs for	complex cases
complex case	requires	multidisciplinary team
multidisciplinary team	collaborates on	management
management	includes	wound care
wound care	includes	dressing changes
dressing changes	required after	excision
excision	associated with	scarring risk
suture removal	scheduled at	follow-up
follow-up	aims to	monitor recurrence
recurrence	indicates	regrowth of lesion
regrowth	may signify	incomplete excision
incomplete excision	necessitates	repeat procedure
repeat procedure	causes	additional scarring
cosmesis	improved by	flap technique
flap technique	used for	large defects
skin graft	used for	extensive defects
graft survival	depends on	vascular supply
vascular supply	affects	graft survival
vascularization	occurs in	wound bed
melanoma	considered for	wide excision
wide excision	appropriate for	melanoma
melanoma	requires	sentinel lymph node biopsy
sentinel lymph node biopsy	performed with	melanoma excision
