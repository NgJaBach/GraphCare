incision	is a	surgical technique
excision	is a	surgical technique
incision	performed on	CNS
excision	performed on	CNS
CNS	includes	brain
CNS	includes	spinal cord
brain	contains	cerebrum
brain	contains	cerebellum
spinal cord	contains	gray matter
spinal cord	contains	white matter
incision	used for	tumor removal
excision	used for	tumor removal
tumor	located in	brain
tumor	located in	spinal cord
tumor	classified as	malignant
tumor	classified as	benign
malignant tumor	requires	aggressive excision
benign tumor	requires	conservative excision
incision	increases	risk of infection
excision	increases	risk of infection
infection	leads to	sepsis
sepsis	leads to	organ failure
organ failure	leads to	mortality
incision	requires	anesthesia
excision	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	can be	general
anesthesia	can be	regional
general anesthesia	increases	postoperative pain
regional anesthesia	reduces	postoperative pain
postoperative pain	managed by	analgesics
analgesics	include	opioids
analgesics	include	NSAIDs
opioids	increase	risk of dependence
NSAIDs	increase	risk of GI bleeding
incision	requires	suturing
excision	requires	suturing
suturing	can be	absorbable
suturing	can be	non‑absorbable
absorbable sutures	reduce	need for removal
non‑absorbable sutures	increase	risk of infection
incision	leads to	scar formation
excision	leads to	scar formation
scar formation	can cause	neurological deficit
neurological deficit	leads to	impaired mobility
impaired mobility	leads to	falls
falls	increase	readmission risk
readmission risk	increases	healthcare cost
incision	requires	postoperative monitoring
excision	requires	postoperative monitoring
postoperative monitoring	includes	vital signs
vital signs	include	blood pressure
vital signs	include	heart rate
vital signs	include	temperature
temperature	indicates	infection
blood pressure	indicates	hemorrhage
hemorrhage	requires	transfusion
transfusion	increases	risk of transfusion reactions
transfusion reactions	increase	morbidity
incision	requires	wound care
excision	requires	wound care
wound care	includes	dressing changes
dressing changes	performed by	nursing staff
nursing staff	trained in	wound assessment
wound assessment	detects	dehiscence
dehiscence	leads to	infection
infection	leads to	prolonged hospital stay
prolonged hospital stay	increases	cost
incision	can be	open
excision	can be	open
open procedure	increases	blood loss
blood loss	requires	blood transfusion
blood transfusion	increases	immunosuppression
immunosuppression	increases	infection risk
incision	can be	minimally invasive
excision	can be	minimally invasive
minimally invasive	reduces	blood loss
minimally invasive	reduces	hospital stay
hospital stay	influences	readmission rate
readmission rate	predicts	mortality
mortality	predicts	long‑term survival
long‑term survival	influenced by	adjuvant therapy
adjuvant therapy	includes	chemotherapy
adjuvant therapy	includes	radiotherapy
chemotherapy	increases	neutropenia
neutropenia	increases	infection risk
radiotherapy	causes	radiation necrosis
radiation necrosis	requires	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	may be	re‑excision
re‑excision	increases	operative risk
operative risk	predicts	postoperative complications
postoperative complications	predict	ICU admission
ICU admission	predicts	mortality
mortality	predicts	quality of life
quality of life	measured by	functional status
functional status	assessed by	Karnofsky score
Karnofsky score	predicts	survival
survival	influenced by	tumor grade
tumor grade	determined by	histopathology
histopathology	performed on	resected tissue
resected tissue	analyzed by	pathologist
