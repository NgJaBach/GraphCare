antibiotic prophylaxis	prevents	surgical site infection
imaging	used for	surgical planning
preoperative assessment	includes	imaging
hallux valgus	associated with	bunion formation
bunion formation	leads to	toe deformity
bunionectomy	reduces	metatarsophalangeal pain
toe deformity	contributes to	abnormal gait

infection	leads to	readmission
scar	affects	cosmetic outcome
scar	improves with	time
hardware removal	may be required after	bunionectomy
implant irritation	causes	pain
recurrence	is a	complication
recurrence	associated with	inadequate correction
recurrence	reduces	patient satisfaction
surgical site infection	increases	readmission
osteotomy	corrects	hallux valgus
incision	influences	scar visibility
incision type	determines	scar visibility

infection prevention	includes	sterile technique
sterile technique	reduces	infection risk
postoperative check	monitors	wound healing
wound healing	depends on	nutrition
nutrition	supports	wound healing
protein intake	supports	wound healing
collagen synthesis	requires	vitamin C
patient satisfaction	measures	outcome
pain score	used for	outcome assessment
outcome assessment	includes	pain score
bone healing	occurs with	osteotomy
osteotomy	allows	hallux valgus correction
