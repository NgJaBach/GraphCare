angioplasty	is a	cardiovascular procedure
angioplasty	improves	blood flow
angioplasty	reduces	angina
angioplasty	uses	stent
stent	prevents	restenosis
stent	is a	device
stent	is implanted	artery
stent	requires	antiplatelet therapy
antiplatelet therapy	reduces	clotting

coronary artery bypass grafting	is a	cardiovascular procedure
CABG	uses	graft
graft	can be	saphenous vein
graft	can be	internal mammary artery
graft	improves	long‑term survival
CABG	performed	operating room
CABG	requires	cardiopulmonary bypass
cardiopulmonary bypass	causes	systemic inflammation
systemic inflammation	increases	infection risk
CABG	associated with	atrial fibrillation
atrial fibrillation	treated with	beta‑blocker
beta‑blocker	reduces	mortality
beta‑blocker	causes	bradycardia
beta‑blocker	contraindicated in	severe asthma
CABG	indicated for	multi‑vessel disease
CABG	reduces	angina
CABG	increases	operative risk
CABG	followed by	statin therapy
statin therapy	reduces	LDL
statin therapy	reduces	plaque progression
statin therapy	causes	myopathy
statin therapy	contraindicated in	active liver disease
valve replacement	is a	cardiovascular procedure
valve replacement	uses	prosthetic valve
prosthetic valve	can be	mechanical
prosthetic valve	can be	bioprosthetic
mechanical valve	requires	warfarin
warfarin	monitored by	INR
INR	target range	2.5‑3.5
warfarin	increases	bleeding risk
bioprosthetic valve	has	limited durability
bioprosthetic valve	requires	re‑intervention
valve replacement	indicated for	severe stenosis
valve replacement	improves	ejection fraction
valve replacement	performed	minimally invasive
minimally invasive	reduces	recovery time
minimally invasive	increases	cost
percutaneous valve implantation	is a	valve replacement
percutaneous valve implantation	uses	transcatheter valve
transcatheter valve	delivered	via femoral artery
femoral artery	accessed	percutaneous
percutaneous valve implantation	reduces	surgical risk
percutaneous valve implantation	associated with	paravalvular leak
paravalvular leak	treated with	surgical repair
transcatheter valve implantation	indicated for	high surgical risk
transcatheter valve implantation	improves	survival
transcatheter valve implantation	requires	imaging guidance
imaging guidance	uses	transesophageal echocardiography
transesophageal echocardiography	contraindicated in	esophageal varices
transesophageal echocardiography	provides	real‑time imaging
transesophageal echocardiography	increases	procedure time
transcatheter valve implantation	followed by	anticoagulation
anticoagulation	reduces	thromboembolism
anticoagulation	increases	bleeding
transcatheter valve implantation	reduces	ICU stay
transcatheter valve implantation	increases	readmission
transcatheter valve implantation	requires	post‑procedure monitoring
post‑procedure monitoring	includes	ECG
ECG	detects	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	treated with	pacemaker
pacemaker	implanted	subcutaneous
pacemaker	requires	device check
device check	scheduled	6 months
device check	scheduled	12 months
pacemaker	increases	longevity
pacemaker	increases	cost
pacemaker	contraindicated in	active infection
pacemaker	used for	bradycardia
pacemaker	used for	tachycardia
pacemaker	improves	quality of life
pacemaker	reduces	syncope
pacemaker	associated with	lead dislodgement
lead dislodgement	treated with	re‑placement
re‑placement	increases	procedural risk
re‑placement	reduces	symptoms
re‑placement	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	increases	postoperative pain
