diagnostic physical therapy	is a	medical evaluation
diagnostic physical therapy	identifies	functional limitations
diagnostic physical therapy	assesses	movement quality
diagnostic physical therapy	identifies	impairments
diagnostic physical therapy	informs	treatment planning
diagnostic physical therapy	informs	prognosis
diagnostic physical therapy	conducted in	outpatient setting
diagnostic physical therapy	uses	standardized tests
standardized tests	measure	range of motion
gait analysis	assesses	gait pattern
gait analysis	detects	asymmetry
balance assessment	evaluates	balance impairment
strength assessment	evaluates	muscle strength
range of motion assessment	measures	joint mobility
postural assessment	identifies	postural deviations
nerve provocation test	detects	neuropathic signs
pain scale	relates to	patient-reported pain
pain intensity	rated on	numeric scale
pain intensity	predicts	analgesic need
outcome measures	include	functional status
functional status	reflects	daily activity capacity
ADL independence	indicates	functional recovery
occupational therapy referral	arises from	diagnostic physical therapy
functional limitation	guides	rehabilitation targets
treatment plan	depends on	diagnostic findings
diagnostic findings	inform	prognosis estimate
clinic setting	provides	diagnostic physical therapy service
acute care unit	provides	diagnostic physical therapy service
inpatient unit	provides	diagnostic physical therapy evaluation
discharge planning	relies on	diagnostic physical therapy results
postoperative status	improves with	diagnostic physical therapy
osteoarthritis	is evaluated by	diagnostic physical therapy
low back pain	assessed for	impairment severity
stroke	requires	gait analysis
knee pain	evaluated for	functional limitation
diagnostic physical therapy	supports	differential diagnosis
differential diagnosis	derived from	clinical examination
clinical examination	contributes to	diagnostic hypothesis
diagnostic hypothesis	tested by	provocative tests
provocative tests	include	neural tension tests
neural tension test	assesses	neural tissue sensitivity
tendon loading test	indicates	tendon pathology
functional assessment	guides	home exercise program
home exercise program	delivered by	physical therapist
physical therapist	schedules	follow-up evaluation
follow-up evaluation	measures	progress
progress	documented in	progress notes
progress notes	summarize	findings
findings	inform	discharge criteria
discharge criteria	require	functional independence
functional independence	achieved with	strengthening program
strengthening program	enhances	muscle endurance
muscle endurance	improves with	resistance training
exercise prescription	comprises	therapeutic exercises
therapeutic exercises	target	range of motion
resistance training	strengthens	muscles
education	provides	patient education
patient education	improves	self-management
self-management	relates to	adherence
adherence	predicts	recovery rate
recovery rate	depends on	therapy adherence
therapy adherence	measured by	patient log
patient log	indicates	activity level
activity level	correlates with	functional outcome
functional outcome	tracked by	outcome measure
outcome measure	include	gait speed
gait speed	predicts	functional recovery
functional recovery	enables	discharge readiness
discharge readiness	allows	home discharge
home discharge	requires	caregiver support
caregiver support	influences	readmission risk
readmission risk	associated with	functional status
functional status	used for	risk stratification
risk stratification	informs	resource allocation
resource allocation	affects	staffing
staffing	influences	therapy access
therapy access	affects	patient satisfaction
outpatient clinic	delivers	diagnostic physical therapy evaluation
insurance authorization	required for	diagnostic physical therapy
reimbursement	tied to	functional outcome
screening	facilitates	triage
triage	directs	referral pathway
referral pathway	includes	physical therapy
timely evaluation	reduces	complication risk
complication risk	increases with	delayed evaluation
delayed evaluation	leads to	worse prognosis
musculoskeletal conditions	contribute to	hospital readmissions
hospital readmissions	preventable by	early diagnostic physical therapy
early diagnostic physical therapy	reduces	length of stay
length of stay	shortened by	early diagnostic physical therapy
early diagnostic physical therapy	reduces	complication rate
collected data	used for	predictive modeling
predictive modeling	informs	risk prediction
risk prediction	supports	discharge planning
gait speed	serves as	functional predictor
functional predictor	used for	prognosis estimation
prognosis estimation	guides	patient counseling
patient counseling	improves	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	enhances	therapy effectiveness
therapy effectiveness	improves	quality of life
