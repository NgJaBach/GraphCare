diagnostic amniocentesis	samples	amniotic fluid
amniotic fluid	contains	fetal DNA
fetal DNA	analyzed for	chromosomal abnormalities
chromosomal abnormalities	include	trisomy 21
chromosomal abnormalities	include	trisomy 18
chromosomal abnormalities	include	trisomy 13
chromosomal abnormalities	include	sex chromosome aneuploidy
chromosomal abnormalities	include	microdeletion syndromes
diagnostic amniocentesis	risk of	miscarriage
miscarriage	risk	0.1‑0.3%
diagnostic amniocentesis	risk of	infection
infection	risk	0.01%
diagnostic amniocentesis	risk of	fetal injury
fetal injury	risk	0.01%
diagnostic amniocentesis	alternative	chorionic villus sampling
chorionic villus sampling	performed at	10‑13 weeks
diagnostic amniocentesis	alternative	non‑invasive prenatal testing
non‑invasive prenatal testing	uses	maternal blood
maternal blood	contains	cell‑free fetal DNA
cell‑free fetal DNA	analyzed for	chromosomal abnormalities
diagnostic amniocentesis	requires	ultrasound guidance
ultrasound guidance	improves	accuracy
diagnostic amniocentesis	requires	sterile technique
sterile technique	reduces	infection
diagnostic amniocentesis	requires	local anesthesia
local anesthesia	reduces	pain
diagnostic amniocentesis	performed by	obstetrician
obstetrician	may use	ultrasound probe
ultrasound probe	visualizes	placenta
placenta	must be	posterior
posterior placenta	allows	safe needle path
needle path	avoids	bladder
needle path	avoids	bowel
diagnostic amniocentesis	yields	amniotic fluid volume
amniotic fluid volume	must be	≥10 mL
amniotic fluid volume	used for	karyotyping
karyotyping	identifies	chromosomal number
karyotyping	identifies	structural rearrangements
diagnostic amniocentesis	yields	DNA sample
DNA sample	used for	PCR
PCR	detects	single‑gene disorders
single‑gene disorders	include	cystic fibrosis
single‑gene disorders	include	sickle cell disease
single‑gene disorders	include	thalassemia
diagnostic amniocentesis	yields	cell culture
cell culture	used for	fluorescence in situ hybridization
fluorescence in situ hybridization	detects	microdeletions
diagnostic amniocentesis	yields	cell culture
cell culture	used for	array CGH
array CGH	detects	copy number variations
diagnostic amniocentesis	yields	cell culture
cell culture	used for	next‑generation sequencing
next‑generation sequencing	detects	rare variants
diagnostic amniocentesis	informs	reproductive decision
reproductive decision	may include	pregnancy termination
reproductive decision	may include	pre‑implantation genetic diagnosis
diagnostic amniocentesis	informs	neonatal care
neonatal care	prepares for	specialized treatment
diagnostic amniocentesis	informs	family counseling
family counseling	addresses	genetic risk
genetic risk	assessed by	family history
family history	guides	screening strategy
screening strategy	may include	carrier testing
carrier testing	identifies	carrier status
carrier status	informs	recurrence risk
recurrence risk	informs	prenatal testing
prenatal testing	may include	diagnostic amniocentesis
diagnostic amniocentesis	requires	informed consent
informed consent	covers	risks and benefits
risks and benefits	discussed by	genetic counselor
genetic counselor	provides	educational materials
educational materials	include	pamphlets
pamphlets	cover	procedure details
procedure details	include	needle size
needle size	typically	22‑gauge
needle size	affects	sample quality
sample quality	affects	diagnostic accuracy
diagnostic accuracy	influences	clinical decision
clinical decision	may affect	maternal anxiety
maternal anxiety	can be reduced by	counseling
counseling	reduces	anxiety
anxiety	impacts	pregnancy outcome
pregnancy outcome	includes	gestational age
gestational age	influences	neonatal morbidity
neonatal morbidity	linked to	chromosomal disorders
chromosomal disorders	increase	mortality risk
mortality risk	can be predicted by	prenatal diagnosis
prenatal diagnosis	improves	survival rates
survival rates	depend on	early intervention
early intervention	requires	accurate diagnosis
accurate diagnosis	provided by	diagnostic amniocentesis
diagnostic amniocentesis	contributes to	population screening
population screening	identifies	high‑risk pregnancies
high‑risk pregnancies	receive	targeted monitoring
targeted monitoring	reduces	readmission risk
readmission risk	mitigated by	early detection
early detection	enabled by	diagnostic amniocentesis
