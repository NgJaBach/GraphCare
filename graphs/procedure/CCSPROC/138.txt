amniocentesis	samples	fetal cells
fetal cells	used for	karyotype analysis
karyotype analysis	detects	chromosomal abnormality
chromosomal abnormality	includes	trisomy 21
trisomy 21	associated with	Down syndrome
Down syndrome	diagnosed by	karyotype analysis
amniocentesis	indicates	fetal genetic disorder
fetal genetic disorder	identified by	amniocentesis
amniocentesis	may cause	cramping
amniocentesis	associated with	membrane rupture
membrane rupture	risk factor for	preterm birth
amniocentesis	carries	miscarriage risk
advanced maternal age	increases	risk of chromosomal abnormality
maternal age	increases	risk of fetal chromosomal abnormality
noninvasive prenatal testing	as alternative to	diagnostic amniocentesis
noninvasive prenatal testing	reduces need for	diagnostic amniocentesis
amniotic fluid	used for	DNA analysis
DNA analysis	detects	genetic variant
genetic variant	found in	amniotic fluid
amniocentesis	used for	prenatal diagnosis
prenatal diagnosis	achieved by	amniocentesis
cytogenetic testing	performed on	amniotic fluid
cytogenetic testing	detects	chromosomal abnormality
amniocentesis	performed in	hospital setting

informed consent	protects	patient rights
patient rights	protected by	informed consent
amniocentesis	affects	maternal mood
maternal mood	influences	clinical decisions
fetal chromosomal abnormality	leads to	pregnancy management changes
pregnancy management changes	include	genetic counseling
genetic counseling	occurs after	amniocentesis
amniocentesis	indicated for	repeat testing
repeat testing	considered when	initial results inconclusive
inconclusive results	require	confirmatory testing
confirmatory testing	includes	amniocentesis re-testing
pregnant patient	undergoes	diagnostic amniocentesis
obstetrician	performs	diagnostic amniocentesis
ultrasound	guides	needle placement
needle placement	monitored by	real-time imaging
real-time imaging	improves	procedure safety
procedure safety	influences	patient satisfaction
fetal status	assessed by	amniocentesis results
amniocentesis results	can be	normal
normal results	associated with	typical pregnancy course
abnormal results	associated with	genetic counseling need
genetic counseling	recommended after	abnormal results
counseling	supports	parental decision making
pregnancy decisions	influenced by	genetic counseling
genetic counseling	provides	risk information
risk information	supports	parental choice
parental choice	impacts	follow-up testing
follow-up testing	includes	targeted sequencing
targeted sequencing	performed on	amniotic fluid
amniotic fluid	used for	sequencing
sequencing	detects	single gene mutation
single gene mutation	identified by	sequencing
sequence data	interpreted by	geneticist
geneticist	communicates	results to parents
parents	participate in	counseling
counseling	supports	informed decision making
decision making	requires	test results
test results	guide	pregnancy management
prenatal diagnosis	confirmed by	amniocentesis
amniocentesis	confirms	fetal status
fetal status	determines	delivery timing
delivery timing	affected by	fetal status
fetal status	influenced by	maternal condition
maternal condition	included in	pregnancy risk assessment
pregnancy risk assessment	informs	clinical planning
clinical planning	improves	perinatal outcomes
perinatal outcomes	predicted by	diagnostic amniocentesis results
diagnostic amniocentesis results	recorded in	patient record
patient record	used for	quality improvement
quality improvement	driven by	outcome data
outcome data	informs	hospital policy
