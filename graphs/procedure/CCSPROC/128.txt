dilatation and curettage	is a	surgical procedure
dilatation and curettage	is performed for	abnormal uterine bleeding
dilatation and curettage	is performed for	miscarriage management
dilatation and curettage	is performed for	abortion management
dilatation and curettage	is performed for	missed abortion
dilatation and curettage	is performed for	incomplete abortion
dilatation and curettage	is performed for	retained products of conception
dilatation and curettage	provides	endometrial tissue
dilatation and curettage	yields	tissue sample
tissue sample	sent to	pathology
pathology	analyzes	tissue sample
tissue sample	examined by	histology
histology	detects	endometrial pathology
endometrial pathology	includes	hyperplasia
endometrial hyperplasia	increases	cancer risk
dilatation and curettage	removes	placental tissue
placental tissue	retained after	abortion
retained products of conception	cause	persistent bleeding
dilatation and curettage	relieves	heavy bleeding
heavy bleeding	may require	transfusion
dilatation and curettage	performed under	anesthesia
anesthesia	can be	general
anesthesia	can be	regional
dilatation and curettage	commonly performed as	outpatient procedure
outpatient procedure	is common setting for	D&C
dilatation and curettage	requires	cervical dilation
cervical dilation	achieved with	dilators
dilatation and curettage	uses	curettes
curette	is used for	curettage
dilatation and curettage	can cause	uterine perforation
uterine perforation	is a possible complication of	dilatation and curettage
dilatation and curettage	can cause	infection
infection	is a possible complication of	dilatation and curettage
dilatation and curettage	can cause	cervical laceration
cervical laceration	is a possible complication of	dilatation and curettage
dilatation and curettage	can cause	intrauterine adhesions
intrauterine adhesions	lead to	infertility
dilatation and curettage	may be performed	after delivery
delivery	may be followed by	lochia
dilatation and curettage	may be performed	following miscarriage
following miscarriage	necessitates	tissue sampling
tissue sampling	guides	subsequent management
dilatation and curettage	used in	postmenopausal bleeding evaluation
postmenopausal bleeding	requires	endometrial assessment
endometrial assessment	often includes	D&C sampling
D&C sampling	can rule out	endometrial cancer
endometrial cancer	diagnosed by	biopsy
biopsy	requires	histopathology
histopathology	confirms	diagnosis
dilatation and curettage	used for	removal of polyps
endometrial polyps	removed by	curettage
polyps	associated with	abnormal bleeding
dilatation and curettage	used for	removal of placental tissue
placental tissue	removed by	dilatation and curettage
dilatation and curettage	is alternative to	suction curettage in certain settings
suction curettage	is used for	abortion management
first-trimester abortion	can be treated with	suction curettage
dilatation and curettage	compared with	suction curettage in terms of complications
complications	include	infection
dilatation and curettage	has	asepsis requirement
asepsis	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	minimized by	prophylactic antibiotics
prophylactic antibiotics	recommended for	D&C in some settings
dilatation and curettage	contraindicated in	active pelvic infection
active pelvic infection	is a contraindication for	D&C
first-trimester abortion	is treated with	suction curettage
dilatation and curettage	used for	retained products after abortion
retained products after abortion	require	uterine evacuation
uterine evacuation	achieved by	D&C
uterine evacuation	also achieved by	suction curettage
suction curettage	commonly used for	first-trimester abortion
first-trimester abortion	often managed with	suction curettage
suction curettage	associated with	less cervical trauma
cervical trauma	risk of	suction curettage
D&C	can be performed with	ultrasound guidance
ultrasound guidance	enhances	visualization of uterine contents
visualization	improves	sampling accuracy
sampling accuracy	reduces	need for repeat procedures
repeat procedures	increase	infection risk
infection risk	mitigated by	antibiotic prophylaxis
antibiotic prophylaxis	recommended for	D&C in some settings
D&C in some settings	contraindicated in	active pelvic infection
active pelvic infection	contraindicates	D&C
dilatation and curettage	used for	abnormal uterine bleeding evaluation
abnormal uterine bleeding evaluation	includes	endometrial sampling
endometrial sampling	used for	endometrial cancer screening
endometrial cancer screening	may involve	transvaginal ultrasound
transvaginal ultrasound	used to assess	intrauterine contents
intrauterine contents	include	blood clots
blood clots	may be evacuated by	D&C
D&C	contributes to	reproductive planning
reproductive planning	improved by	accurate endometrial evaluation
endometrial evaluation	guides	management
management	includes	medical therapy
medical therapy	includes	hormonal therapy
hormonal therapy	used for	abnormal uterine bleeding after D&C
abnormal uterine bleeding	may persist	after D&C
D&C	requires	skilled operator
skilled operator	improves	safety of procedure
safety	improved by	standardized protocols
