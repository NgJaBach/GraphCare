intravenous pyelogram	reveals	hydronephrosis
intravenous pyelogram	reveals	ureteral stone
intravenous pyelogram	shows	ureteral stricture
intravenous pyelogram	visualizes	renal pelvis
intravenous pyelogram	contraindicated in	iodide allergy
intravenous pyelogram	contraindicated in	pregnancy
intravenous pyelogram	contraindicated in	severe kidney disease
intravenous pyelogram	alternative test	CT urogram
intravenous pyelogram	alternative test	renal ultrasound
iodinated contrast	excreted by	kidneys
iodinated contrast	requires	hydration
iodinated contrast	carries	allergic reaction
iodinated contrast	carries	nephrotoxicity
contrast-induced nephropathy	risk factors	dehydration
contrast-induced nephropathy	associated with	preexisting kidney disease
preexisting kidney disease	increases	risk of nephrotoxicity
nephrotoxicity	mitigated by	hydration
hydration	reduces	contrast nephrotoxicity
radiation exposure	increases	cancer risk
intravenous pyelogram	carries	radiation exposure
contrast media	can cause	nephrotoxicity
contrast media	can cause	allergic reaction
iodinated contrast	can cause	anaphylaxis
anaphylaxis risk	higher in	previous contrast reaction
previous contrast reaction	increases	adverse event risk
kidney function	evaluated by	serum creatinine
serum creatinine	used to estimate	glomerular filtration rate
glomerular filtration rate	decreases with	age
age	increases	risk of nephrotoxicity
intravenous pyelogram	replaced by	CT urography
CT urography	offers	higher diagnostic yield than IVP
CT urography	replaces	intravenous pyelogram
urinary tract evaluation	performed by	intravenous pyelogram
contrast administration	requires	preprocedure evaluation
preprocedure evaluation	includes	renal function testing
renal function testing	includes	creatinine level
creatinine level	used for	nephrotoxicity risk stratification
nephrotoxicity risk stratification	informs	contrast dosing
contrast dosing	adjusted for	renal function
renal function	affects	contrast dosing
contrast dosing	impacts	contrast toxicity
blood pressure	monitored during	intravenous pyelogram
blood pressure	influences	renal perfusion
renal perfusion	affected by	contrast media
intravenous pyelogram	requires	allergy screening
allergy screening	includes	iodide allergy
iodide allergy	contraindicates	iodinated contrast
iodinated contrast	interacts with	thyroid function
thyroid function	affected by	iodinated contrast
thyroid function	assessed before	iodinated contrast administration
contrast administration	documented in	radiology report
radiology report	includes	imaging findings
imaging findings	influence	clinical management
intravenous pyelogram	useful for	detecting ureteral obstruction
hydration status	affects	contrast tolerance
contrast tolerance	improves with	hydration
dehydration	increases	risk of nephrotoxicity
nephrotoxicity risk	reduced by	hydration and dose optimization
dose optimization	includes	lower iodinated contrast dose
lower iodinated contrast dose	reduces	toxicity
contrast dose	adjusted for	kidney impairment
kidney impairment	associated with	reduced clearance
reduced clearance	increases	duration of contrast in body
contrast exposure duration	correlates with	nephrotoxicity risk
nephrotoxicity risk	guides	patient selection
risk minimization	achieved by	alternative imaging
alternative imaging	includes	ultrasound
ultrasound	alternative to	IVP in certain cases
ultrasound	limited by	patient body habitus
calcifications	seen on	IVP
stone	visualized on	IVP
stone	located in	renal pelvis
stone	cause	obstruction
obstruction	identified by	IVP
hydronephrosis	detected by	IVP
IVP	provides	opacification of urinary tract
opacification	facilitates	diagnosis of obstruction
obstruction	leads to	hydronephrosis
hydronephrosis	indicates	urinary tract blockage
urinary tract blockage	management involves	decompression
decompression	performed by	stent placement
contrast medium	cleared by	kidneys
renal clearance	determines	duration of contrast in body
duration of contrast	affects	imaging quality
imaging quality	affected by	patient motion
patient motion	reduces	imaging clarity
contrast agent	contraindications include	iodine allergy
iodine allergy	present in	patient history
patient history	documented in	chart
chart	reviewed prior to	contrast administration
contrast administration	requires	informed consent
informed consent	ensures	patient understanding
patient understanding	affects	procedure compliance
procedure completion	informs	medical record
medical record	used for	clinical research
clinical research	informs	medical knowledge
