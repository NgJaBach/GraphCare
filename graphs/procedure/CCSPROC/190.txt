contrast arteriogram	is a	diagnostic imaging procedure
contrast arteriogram	uses	iodinated contrast
contrast arteriogram	visualizes	femoral artery
contrast arteriogram	visualizes	popliteal artery
contrast arteriogram	visualizes	tibial arteries
contrast arteriogram	visualizes	collateral circulation
contrast arteriogram	detects	arterial occlusion
contrast arteriogram	detects	arterial stenosis
arterial stenosis	causes	reduced perfusion
arterial occlusion	leads to	ischemia
ischemia	increases	risk of limb loss
limb loss	risks	amputation
collateral circulation	maintains	distal perfusion
femoral artery	is accessed via	puncture
puncture	risks	hematoma
iodinated contrast	can cause	allergic reaction
iodinated contrast	can cause	nephrotoxicity
nephrotoxicity	risk factors	pre-existing kidney disease
contrast arteriogram	may cause	contrast-induced nephropathy
contrast-induced nephropathy	is a	kidney injury
contrast arteriogram	guides	endovascular therapy
endovascular therapy	includes	angioplasty
angioplasty	uses	balloon dilation
balloon dilation	expands	stenotic segments
stenosis	occurs in	femoral artery
arterial access	is obtained by	puncture
puncture	can cause	hematoma
hematoma	is a	complication
contrast arteriogram	carries	radiation exposure
radiation exposure	increases	cancer risk
contrast arteriogram	can cause	allergic reaction
allergic reaction	risk factors	prior iodine sensitivity
prior iodine sensitivity	is a	risk factor for reaction
contrast arteriogram	enables	targeted intervention
targeted intervention	includes	angioplasty
angioplasty	may be followed by	stent deployment
stent deployment	improves	vessel patency
vessel patency	determines	flow
flow	influences	tissue perfusion
tissue perfusion	affects	limb viability
limb viability	predicts	salvage probability
salvage probability	impacts	hospitalization duration
contrast arteriogram	complements	duplex ultrasound
duplex ultrasound	assesses	blood flow velocity
blood flow velocity	reflects	flow status
flow status	guides	revascularization planning
revascularization planning	relies on	arteriography findings
arteriography findings	inform	stent sizing
stent sizing	determines	stent diameter
stent diameter	affects	radial strength
radial strength	relates to	stent patency
stent patency	predicts	long-term outcomes
long-term outcomes	depend on	perfusion restoration
perfusion restoration	achieved by	revascularization
revascularization	can be	endovascular or surgical
endovascular revascularization	uses	angioplasty
surgical revascularization	uses	bypass graft
bypass graft	is a	surgical intervention
autologous graft	is a	graft type
distal runoff assessment	informs	bypass planning
