blood transfusion	is a	medical procedure
blood transfusion	uses	blood product
blood product	sourced from	donor
donor	provides	blood unit
blood bank	coordinates	transfusion
crossmatch	ensures	ABO compatibility
type and screen	identifies	recipient blood type
type and screen	screens	recipient antibodies
pretransfusion testing	includes	antibody screen
pretransfusion testing	ensures	compatibility
packed red blood cells	are a	blood product
platelets	are a	blood product
plasma	is a	blood product
whole blood	is a	blood product
PRBC transfusion	treats	anemia
PRBC transfusion	indicated for	low hemoglobin
platelet transfusion	indicated for	thrombocytopenia
plasma transfusion	indicated for	coagulopathy
massive transfusion	indicated for	exsanguinating hemorrhage
postpartum hemorrhage	treated with	transfusion
surgery	increases	transfusion need
trauma	increases	transfusion need
bone marrow failure	may require	transfusion
cancer chemotherapy	causes	anemia
sickle cell disease	often requires	transfusion
thalassemia	often requires	transfusion
obstetric hemorrhage	managed with	transfusion
neonatal transfusion	used for	anemia of prematurity
donor unit	stored under	refrigeration
donor unit	tested for	infections
infection screening	reduces	transfusion-transmitted infections
transfusion-transmitted infections	include	hepatitis B
transfusion-transmitted infections	include	hepatitis C
transfusion-transmitted infections	include	HIV
iron overload	results from	repeated transfusions
iron overload	causes	organ damage
chelation therapy	treats	iron overload
alloimmunization	increases	alloantibody formation
allo antibody formation	complicates	future transfusions
hemolytic transfusion reaction	occurs as	transfusion reaction type
febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction	occurs as	transfusion reaction type
allergic transfusion reaction	occurs as	transfusion reaction type
transfusion reaction	can occur during	transfusion
TRALI	is a	transfusion complication
TACO	is a	transfusion complication
volume overload	risk with	rapid transfusion
citrate	used as	preservative in stored blood
citrate	can cause	hypocalcemia
crossmatch	reduces	transfusion incompatibility
type and screen	reduces	transfusion risk
ABO compatibility	ensures	transfusion safety
Rh compatibility	ensures	transfusion safety
donor screening	reduces	infectious risk
emergency transfusion	uses	type O negative
universal donor concept	relates to	type O negative
massive transfusion protocol	guides	rapid transfusion
rapid transfusion	reduces	time to resuscitation
transfusion protocol	minimizes	transfusion errors
labelling accuracy	reduces	transfusion errors
barcoding	improves	transfusion safety
transfusion service	coordinates	donor selection
recipient	monitored for	transfusion reaction
vital signs	monitored during	transfusion
posttransfusion monitoring	includes	hemoglobin check
hemoglobin	increases after	transfusion
oxygen delivery	improves with	transfusion
tissue oxygenation	improves with	transfusion
fatigue	alleviated by	transfusion
dyspnea	relieved by	transfusion
transfusion	influences	hospital length of stay
hospital length of stay	increases with	transfusion complication
safety testing	ensures	blood product safety
storage conditions	vary by	blood product
PRBCs	stored under	refrigerated conditions
platelets	stored at	room temperature
plasma	stored at	frozen state
blood product	has	expiration
donor exposure	increases	alloimmunization risk
recipient	receives	donor unit
donor unit	matched to	recipient
compatibility testing	guides	donor selection
blood type	determined by	genetics
ABO group	determines	donor compatibility
Rh group	determines	donor compatibility
emergency transfusion	requires	rapid decision making
perioperative planning	influenced by	transfusion history
pediatric patient	requires	adjusted transfusion protocol
neonatal patient	requires	careful transfusion
elderly patient	higher risk	transfusion-related complications
transfusion history	predicts	future transfusion risk
predicted transfusion need	guides	donor selection
safety protocol	enforces	double-checking labels
double-checking labels	prevents	mis-transfusion
mis-transfusion	causes	patient harm
informed consent	required for	transfusion
informed consent	documents	transfusion risks
education	provided for	clinicians about transfusion
audit	assesses	transfusion outcomes
quality improvement	targets	transfusion safety
standard of care	includes	blood transfusion management
