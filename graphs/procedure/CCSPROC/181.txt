myelogram	is a	diagnostic imaging procedure
myelogram	uses	intrathecal contrast
intrathecal contrast	is a	radiopaque substance
lumbar puncture	provides	intrathecal access
intrathecal injection	delivers	contrast agent
contrast agent	enables	radiographic visualization
myelogram	visualizes	spinal nerve roots
myelogram	visualizes	thecal sac
thecal sac	contains	cerebrospinal fluid
spinal canal	is evaluated by	myelogram
nerve root compression	is detected by	myelogram
disc herniation	is visualized by	myelogram
spinal stenosis	is visualized by	myelogram
tumor	is detected by	myelogram
arachnoiditis	is a	complication of myelography
post-dural puncture headache	is a	complication
infection	is a	complication
contrast allergy	is a	contraindication
iodinated contrast	carries risk of	allergic reaction
coagulopathy	is a	contraindication
intrathecal injection	carries risk of	CSF leak
CSF leak	can cause	postural headache
post-myelography headache	is a	symptom
radiation exposure	is associated with	CT myelography
CT myelography	provides	cross-sectional detail
CT myelography	is performed after	myelography
MRI	is an	alternative
MRI	avoids	intrathecal contrast
contrast agent	is cleared by	kidneys
kidneys	filter	contrast agent
renal function	influences	contrast clearance
image quality	improves with	patient positioning
lumbar region	is typical access site for	myelography
lateral decubitus position	is used for	CT myelography
prone position	is used for	myelography
subarachnoid space	fills with	contrast agent
nerve root	appears as	indentation
thecal sac indentation	indicates	compression
spinal cord compression	is a	critical finding
myelography findings	correlate with	clinical symptoms
surgical planning	benefits from	myelography
clinical symptoms	accompany	radicular pain
radicular pain	accompanies	myelography findings
contrast distribution	varies with	patient position
post-procedure monitoring	includes	vital signs
vital signs	are monitored after	myelography
patient preparation	includes	allergy history
informed consent	is required for	myelography
sedation	is optional for	pediatric myelography
pediatric patient	may require	alternative imaging
contrast-induced nephropathy	is a risk in	myelography
oil-based contrast	is rarely used in	modern myelography
oil-based contrast	is associated with	arachnoiditis
arachnoiditis	can cause	chronic pain
pseudomyelography	refers to	historical myelography
water-soluble contrast	is used in	modern myelography
fluoroscopy	provides	real-time imaging
fluoroscopy	guides	needle placement
needle placement	affects	complication risk
sterile technique	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	is minimized by	sterile technique
allergy screening	informs	contrast choice
contrast administration	requires	allergy screening
contrast distribution	depends on	patient position
radiographic interpretation	depends on	radiologist expertise
radiologist	interprets	imaging findings
imaging findings	include	nerve root compression
nerve root compression	signals	radiculopathy
radiculopathy	presents with	leg pain
spinal canal stenosis	leads to	nerve compression
dural sac	encircles	spinal cord
spinal cord	lies within	vertebral column
vertebral column	protects	spinal cord
surgical planning	relies on	imaging results
imaging results	guide	surgical approach
myelography	can inform	decompression surgery
decompression surgery	indicated by	nerve compression findings
degenerative changes	contribute to	canal narrowing
canal narrowing	increases	radiculopathy risk
post-procedure discharge	occurs after	myelography
discharge instructions	include	hydration rest
hydration	helps prevent	headache
rest period	is recommended for	postoperative care
activity restriction	is recommended for	postoperative period
rehydration	supports	recovery
contrast leakage	leads to	local pain
local pain	resolves with	time
pediatric myelogram	requires	sedation
sedation	reduces	patient movement
patient movement	reduces	imaging quality
imaging quality	improves with	cooperation
cooperation	depends on	patient understanding
patient understanding	improves	consent quality
consent quality	affects	diagnostic accuracy
diagnostic accuracy	enables	appropriate treatment
treatment options	include	surgical and non-surgical
surgical options	include	decompression
non-surgical options	include	physical therapy
physical therapy	supports	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	improves	functional outcome
