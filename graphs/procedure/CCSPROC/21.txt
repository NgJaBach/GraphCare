extraocular muscle	is a	muscle
orbit	is a	anatomical region
therapeutic procedure	is a	medical intervention
extraocular muscle	located in	orbit
orbit	contains	extraocular muscle
extraocular muscle	controls	eye movement
eye movement	is a	ocular function
ocular function	is essential for	vision
vision	is impaired by	strabismus
strabismus	is caused by	extraocular muscle dysfunction
extraocular muscle	can be treated by	strabismus surgery
strabismus surgery	is a	therapeutic procedure
strabismus surgery	improves	ocular alignment
ocular alignment	is necessary for	binocular vision
binocular vision	reduces	double vision
double vision	is a	symptom
symptom	indicates	extraocular muscle disorder
extraocular muscle disorder	can be diagnosed by	MRI
MRI	is a	imaging modality
imaging modality	provides	anatomical detail
anatomical detail	guides	surgical planning
surgical planning	is part of	operative procedure
operative procedure	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	can be general	or local
local anesthesia	reduces	postoperative pain
postoperative pain	is managed by	analgesics
analgesics	include	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	are a	drug class
drug class	is prescribed for	pain control
pain control	improves	patient comfort
patient comfort	influences	recovery time
recovery time	affects	readmission risk
readmission risk	is a	predictive factor
predictive factor	informs	discharge planning
discharge planning	involves	patient education
patient education	reduces	complications
complications	increase	mortality risk
mortality risk	is a	clinical outcome
clinical outcome	is monitored by	follow‑up visits
follow‑up visits	assess	surgical success
surgical success	is measured by	ocular alignment
ocular alignment	is measured by	prism cover test
prism cover test	is a	diagnostic test
diagnostic test	informs	treatment efficacy
treatment efficacy	predicts	long‑term vision
long‑term vision	is a	quality of life metric
quality of life metric	is used in	health economics
health economics	evaluates	cost‑effectiveness
cost‑effectiveness	guides	healthcare policy
healthcare policy	determines	procedure reimbursement
procedure reimbursement	influences	provider adoption
provider adoption	affects	procedure availability
procedure availability	impacts	patient access
patient access	is linked to	health disparities
health disparities	are addressed by	public health initiatives
public health initiatives	include	screening programs
screening programs	detect	early strabismus
early strabismus	leads to	less invasive surgery
less invasive surgery	reduces	complication rate
complication rate	is a	safety metric
safety metric	is monitored by	adverse event reporting
adverse event reporting	is part of	pharmacovigilance
pharmacovigilance	ensures	drug safety
drug safety	is critical for	patient trust
patient trust	improves	adherence
adherence	is a	predictor of outcome
predictor of outcome	is used in	risk stratification
risk stratification	informs	clinical decision support
clinical decision support	recommends	surgical approach
surgical approach	can be	muscle recession
muscle recession	is a	surgical technique
surgical technique	is chosen based on	muscle length
muscle length	is measured by	intraoperative assessment
intraoperative assessment	uses	surgical microscope
surgical microscope	enhances	precision
precision	reduces	surgical error
surgical error	lowers	morbidity
morbidity	is a	outcome measure
outcome measure	is reported in	clinical trials
clinical trials	generate	evidence
evidence	informs	guideline development
guideline development	sets	standard of care
standard of care	dictates	treatment protocols
treatment protocols	are updated by	expert consensus
expert consensus	considers	patient preferences
patient preferences	influence	shared decision making
shared decision making	improves	satisfaction
satisfaction	correlates with	adherence
adherence	affects	long‑term outcomes
long‑term outcomes	include	visual acuity
visual acuity	is measured by	Snellen chart
Snellen chart	is a	visual test
visual test	is part of	ophthalmic examination
ophthalmic examination	is performed by	optometrist
optometrist	collaborates with	ophthalmologist
ophthalmologist	performs	strabismus surgery
strabismus surgery	requires	surgical team
surgical team	includes	surgeon
surgeon	is trained in	ocular surgery
ocular surgery	is a	subspecialty
