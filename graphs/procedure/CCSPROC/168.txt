incision and drainage	is a	medical procedure
incision and drainage	treats	abscess
abscess	contains	pus
pus	drained by	incision and drainage
abscess	located in	skin and subcutaneous tissue
skin and subcutaneous tissue	includes	dermis
abscess	associated with	cellulitis
cellulitis	affects	skin
incision and drainage	performed under	local anesthesia
local anesthesia	provides	analgesia
analgesia	reduces	pain
pain	managed with	analgesia
abscess	treated with	incision and drainage
incision and drainage	often performed in	clinic
clinic	setting for	minor procedures
antibiotics	used for	skin and soft tissue infections
abscess	drainage yields	pus
pus	sample	culture
culture	guides	antibiotic selection
abscess size	influences	drainage extent
drainage extent	affects	wound healing
wound healing	occurs by	secondary intention
secondary intention	describes	healing pattern
scar	may form	after incision and drainage
scar	has	cosmetic impact
bleeding	is a potential complication of	incision and drainage
bleeding	requires	hemostasis
hematoma	can occur	after incision and drainage
hematoma	delays	healing
infection	risk after	incision and drainage
inadequate drainage	increases	recurrence risk
recurrence	occurs after	drainage
diabetes	increases	infection risk
diabetes	increases	complication risk
immunocompromised	increases	infection risk
antibiotic prophylaxis	indicated for	high-risk abscesses
high-risk abscesses	include	facial abscess
facial abscess	requires	urgent drainage
urgent drainage	prevents	airway obstruction
airway obstruction	risk with	facial abscess
facial abscess	located in	face
incision site	requires	sterile technique
sterile technique	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	higher in	diabetic patients
diabetic patients	have	higher infection risk
drainage	yields	pus sample
pus sample	analyzed by	microbiology
microbiology	identifies	pathogens
pathogens	include	Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus aureus	common organism in	skin abscess
MRSA	can complicate	skin abscess
MRSA	treated with	specific antibiotics
antibiotics	chosen based on	culture results
culture results	guide	antibiotic selection
ultrasound	guides	incision and drainage
CT scan	guides	incision and drainage
deep abscess	requires	imaging-guided drainage
imaging-guided drainage	uses	ultrasound
edema	reduces	after drainage
drainage	relieves	local pressure
local pressure	contributes to	pain
pain	decreases	with drainage
drainage	improves	swelling
swelling	reduces	after drainage
abscess	resolves	after drainage
abscess	leads to	resolution of infection
resolution of infection	depends on	adequate drainage
wound care	includes	dressing changes
dressing changes	performed by	clinician
clinician	observes	wound healing
wound healing	completed	gradually
healing	follows	phases
phases	include	inflammation
inflammation	peaks	within 24-48 hours
inflammation	subsides	with treatment
antibiotics	may be extended	depending on infection
abscess	can be	recurrent
recurrence	risk factor	incomplete drainage
incomplete drainage	occurs due to	missed pockets
missed pockets	cause	persistent infection
persistent infection	requires	repeat drainage
repeat drainage	performed	if recurrence
outcome	improves after	drainage
end result	is	resolution of abscess
