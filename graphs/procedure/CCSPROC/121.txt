ligation	is a	surgical technique
occlusion	is a	surgical technique
fallopian tube	is a	reproductive organ
ligation	performed on	fallopian tube
occlusion	performed on	fallopian tube
fallopian tube	prevents	pregnancy
ligation	prevents	pregnancy
occlusion	prevents	pregnancy
ligation	reduces	ectopic pregnancy risk
occlusion	reduces	ectopic pregnancy risk
fallopian tube	susceptible to	infection
infection	increases	infertility risk
ligation	indicated for	infertility treatment
occlusion	indicated for	infertility treatment
fallopian tube	can be	damaged
damage	leads to	infertility
ligation	causes	scar tissue
occlusion	causes	scar tissue
scar tissue	may lead to	adhesions
adhesions	cause	chronic pelvic pain
chronic pelvic pain	leads to	decreased quality of life
ligation	performed via	laparoscopy
occlusion	performed via	laparoscopy
laparoscopy	is a	minimally invasive surgery
minimally invasive surgery	reduces	hospital stay
hospital stay	reduces	healthcare cost
ligation	has	low complication rate
occlusion	has	low complication rate
complication	includes	bleeding
complication	includes	infection
bleeding	requires	blood transfusion
infection	requires	antibiotics
antibiotics	may cause	antibiotic resistance
antibiotic resistance	increases	treatment complexity
ligation	can be	reversible
occlusion	can be	reversible
reversible	requires	hysteroscopic surgery
hysteroscopic surgery	is a	office procedure
office procedure	reduces	anesthesia risk
anesthesia risk	reduces	postoperative complications
postoperative complications	include	nausea
nausea	treated with	antiemetics
antiemetics	may cause	sedation
sedation	contraindicated in	elderly
elderly	have	higher surgical risk
higher surgical risk	leads to	alternative contraception
alternative contraception	includes	IUD
IUD	is a	long‑acting reversible contraceptive
long‑acting reversible contraceptive	reduces	pregnancy risk
pregnancy risk	reduces	maternal morbidity
maternal morbidity	reduces	neonatal complications
neonatal complications	include	low birth weight
low birth weight	associated with	infant mortality
infant mortality	reduces	public health burden
public health burden	reduces	healthcare expenditure
healthcare expenditure	reduces	insurance premiums
insurance premiums	reduce	patient affordability
patient affordability	increases	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	improves	clinical outcomes
clinical outcomes	measured by	readmission rate
readmission rate	decreases	after laparoscopy
laparoscopy	requires	postoperative pain control
postoperative pain control	uses	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	contraindicated in	renal impairment
renal impairment	requires	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	guided by	creatinine clearance
creatinine clearance	estimated by	Cockcroft‑Gault
Cockcroft‑Gault	predicts	drug clearance
drug clearance	informs	dosing schedule
dosing schedule	affects	drug efficacy
drug efficacy	influences	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	predicts	adherence
adherence	predicts	long‑term outcomes
long‑term outcomes	include	reduced ectopic pregnancy
reduced ectopic pregnancy	reduces	emergency surgery
emergency surgery	increases	ICU admission
ICU admission	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	reduced by	preventive surgery
preventive surgery	includes	tubal ligation
tubal ligation	is a	permanent contraception
permanent contraception	reduces	unintended pregnancy
unintended pregnancy	increases	maternal depression
maternal depression	treated with	SSRIs
SSRIs	may interact with	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	increase	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	monitored by	hemoglobin level
hemoglobin level	measured by	CBC
CBC	indicates	anemia
anemia	treated with	iron supplementation
iron supplementation	causes	gastrointestinal upset
gastrointestinal upset	managed with	slow‑release formulation
slow‑release formulation	improves	adherence
adherence	reduces	iron deficiency
iron deficiency	reduces	fatigue
fatigue	improves	work productivity
work productivity	reduces	absenteeism
absenteeism	reduces	economic burden
economic burden	reduces	societal cost
