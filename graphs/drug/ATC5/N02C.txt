antimigraine preparations	are	medication
antimigraine preparations	treat	migraine
antimigraine preparations	include	triptans
triptans	block	serotonin receptors
serotonin receptors	located on	cranial arteries
cranial arteries	dilate during	migraine
triptans	cause	vasoconstriction
vasoconstriction	reduces	headache
antimigraine preparations	contain	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	inhibit	COX enzymes
COX enzymes	produce	prostaglandins
prostaglandins	sensitize	pain receptors
pain receptors	transmit	pain signals
antimigraine preparations	include	ergotamine
ergotamine	is	vasoconstrictor
vasoconstrictor	limits	blood flow
limited blood flow	decreases	neurogenic inflammation
neurogenic inflammation	triggers	migraine
antimigraine preparations	are	prescription drugs
prescription drugs	require	physician evaluation
physician evaluation	assesses	contraindications
contraindications	include	cardiovascular disease
cardiovascular disease	increases	risk of stroke
stroke	is	severe complication
antimigraine preparations	may cause	nausea
nausea	leads to	poor compliance
poor compliance	reduces	treatment efficacy
treatment efficacy	predicts	remission
remission	lowers	recurrence
recurrence	increases	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	affect	insurance premiums
insurance premiums	influence	medication adherence
medication adherence	determines	long‑term outcome
long‑term outcome	predicts	mortality
mortality	associated with	chronic migraine
chronic migraine	linked to	depression
depression	worsens	pain perception
pain perception	modulates	opioid use
opioid use	raises	risk of dependence
dependence	leads to	readmission
readmission	signals	disease severity
disease severity	informs	treatment escalation
treatment escalation	may involve	neuromodulation
neuromodulation	includes	occipital nerve stimulation
occipital nerve stimulation	reduces	headache frequency
headache frequency	predicts	quality of life
quality of life	correlates with	productivity
productivity	impacts	socioeconomic status
socioeconomic status	influences	access to care
access to care	determines	early intervention
early intervention	decreases	disability
disability	reduces	caregiver burden
caregiver burden	affects	mental health
mental health	affects	medication choice
medication choice	guided by	pharmacogenomics
pharmacogenomics	identifies	CYP2D6 variants
CYP2D6 variants	alter	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	affects	plasma concentration
plasma concentration	determines	therapeutic window
therapeutic window	predicts	adverse events
adverse events	include	hepatotoxicity
hepatotoxicity	monitored by	liver enzymes
liver enzymes	measured	ALT/AST
ALT/AST	elevated	indicates	liver injury
liver injury	necessitates	drug discontinuation
drug discontinuation	may cause	rebound headache
rebound headache	increases	medication overuse
medication overuse	leads to	medication‑overuse headache
medication‑overuse headache	requires	withdrawal
withdrawal	managed by	low‑dose triptans
low‑dose triptans	reduce	side‑effect profile
side‑effect profile	improves	adherence
adherence	linked to	treatment satisfaction
treatment satisfaction	predicts	patient retention
patient retention	affects	longitudinal data quality
longitudinal data quality	supports	predictive modeling
predictive modeling	identifies	high‑risk patients
high‑risk patients	benefit from	prophylactic therapy
prophylactic therapy	includes	beta‑blockers
beta‑blockers	reduce	sympathetic tone
sympathetic tone	lowers	blood pressure
blood pressure	monitored by	home BP
home BP	informs	medication titration
medication titration	optimizes	efficacy
efficacy	reduces	emergency visits
emergency visits	decrease	hospital admissions
hospital admissions	lower	readmission risk
readmission risk	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	obesity
obesity	increases	inflammation
inflammation	exacerbates	migraine
migraine	worsens	sleep quality
sleep quality	impacts	cognitive function
cognitive function	affects	daily activity
daily activity	measured by	activity tracker
activity tracker	provides	objective data
