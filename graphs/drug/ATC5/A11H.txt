vitamin preparations	belong to	ATC
ATC	classifies	drugs
vitamin preparations	are	supplements
supplements	contain	vitamins
vitamins	are	micronutrients
micronutrients	required for	metabolism
vitamin preparations	used for	deficiency
deficiency	leads to	disease
disease	can be	anemia
anemia	treated with	iron
iron	is	vitamin B2
vitamin B2	also called	riboflavin
riboflavin	needed for	energy
energy	produced by	mitochondria
mitochondria	generate	ATP
ATP	fuels	cellular
cellular	processes	repair
repair	prevents	aging
aging	associated with	frailty
frailty	increases	fall risk
fall risk	predicts	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	comorbidity
comorbidity	includes	diabetes
diabetes	treated with	insulin
insulin	is	hormone
hormone	regulates	glucose
glucose	level	affects	kidney
kidney	function	impacts	drug clearance
drug clearance	predicts	drug toxicity
drug toxicity	leads to	adverse events
adverse events	increase	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	age
age	correlates with	vitamin D
vitamin D	deficiency	causes	osteoporosis
osteoporosis	leads to	fractures
fractures	increase	mortality
mortality	influenced by	gender
gender	affects	hormone levels
hormone levels	influence	bone density
bone density	predicts	fracture risk
fracture risk	predicts	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	smoking
smoking	reduces	vitamin C
vitamin C	antioxidant	function
antioxidant	reduces	oxidative stress
oxidative stress	causes	inflammation
inflammation	predicts	cardiovascular disease
cardiovascular disease	leads to	mortality
mortality	influenced by	alcohol
alcohol	depletes	B vitamins
B vitamins	include	folate
folate	prevents	neural tube defects
neural tube defects	increase	neonatal mortality
neonatal mortality	influenced by	prenatal vitamins
prenatal vitamins	contain	folate
folate	required for	DNA synthesis
DNA synthesis	essential for	cell division
cell division	necessary for	growth
growth	requires	protein
protein	sourced from	diet
diet	includes	vitamin B12
vitamin B12	deficiency	causes	neuropathy
neuropathy	leads to	falls
falls	predict	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	socioeconomic status
socioeconomic status	affects	access to vitamins
access	determines	supplementation
supplementation	improves	health outcomes
health outcomes	influence	quality of life
quality of life	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	ethnicity
ethnicity	correlates with	vitamin K
vitamin K	required for	clotting
clotting	prevents	hemorrhage
hemorrhage	increases	mortality
mortality	influenced by	body mass index
body mass index	associated with	vitamin A
vitamin A	deficiency	causes	night blindness
night blindness	leads to	accidents
accidents	increase	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	genetic factors
genetic factors	affect	vitamin metabolism
vitamin metabolism	determines	drug response
drug response	predicts	adverse events
adverse events	increase	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	immune status
immune status	modulated by	vitamin E
vitamin E	antioxidant	function
antioxidant	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	frailty index
frailty index	includes	vitamin D
vitamin D	supplementation	reduces	fracture risk
