peritoneal dialysis	is a	renal replacement therapy
peritoneal dialysis	treats	end‑stage kidney disease
peritoneal dialysis	reduces	hospitalization rate
peritoneal dialysis	improves	quality of life
peritoneal dialysis	requires	peritoneal catheter
peritoneal catheter	is inserted	surgically
surgical insertion	needs	local anesthesia
peritoneal dialysis	uses	dialysate solution
dialysate solution	contains	glucose
dialysate solution	contains	electrolytes
dialysate solution	may contain	icodextrin
icodextrin	provides	long‑term ultrafiltration
peritoneal dialysis	can be	continuous ambulatory
peritoneal dialysis	can be	automated
automated	uses	cycler machine
cycler machine	operates	overnight
overnight	reduces	patient burden
patient burden	decreases	caregiver stress
peritoneal dialysis	has	lower infection risk
lower infection risk	compared to	hemodialysis
peritoneal dialysis	has	lower cardiovascular risk
lower cardiovascular risk	leads to	reduced mortality
reduced mortality	improves	survival rate
survival rate	depends on	patient age
patient age	influences	dialysis modality choice
dialysis modality choice	guided by	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	peritonitis risk
peritonitis	is	catheter infection
catheter infection	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	selected by	culture sensitivity
culture sensitivity	obtained from	peritoneal fluid
peritoneal fluid	sampled by	peritoneal tap
peritoneal tap	performed	bedside
bedside	reduces	transport time
transport time	affects	treatment delay
treatment delay	worsens	outcomes
outcomes	measured by	dialysis adequacy
dialysis adequacy	quantified by	Kt/V
Kt/V	calculated from	creatinine clearance
creatinine clearance	measured by	urine collection
urine collection	requires	patient compliance
patient compliance	influenced by	education level
education level	improves	self‑care
self‑care	reduces	technique failure
technique failure	leads to	modality switch
modality switch	often to	hemodialysis
hemodialysis	associated with	vascular access
vascular access	can be	arteriovenous fistula
arteriovenous fistula	has	lower infection rate
lower infection rate	improves	patient survival
patient survival	influenced by	nutritional status
nutritional status	assessed by	serum albumin
serum albumin	predicts	mortality risk
mortality risk	used in	risk stratification
risk stratification	guides	treatment plan
treatment plan	includes	medication adjustment
medication adjustment	considers	drug clearance
drug clearance	reduced by	kidney failure
kidney failure	necessitates	dose reduction
dose reduction	prevents	drug toxicity
drug toxicity	monitored by	laboratory tests
laboratory tests	include	electrolytes
electrolytes	monitored for	hyperkalemia
hyperkalemia	treated with	dialysis
dialysis	can be	peritoneal
peritoneal	provides	continuous fluid removal
continuous fluid removal	maintains	fluid balance
fluid balance	affects	blood pressure
blood pressure	regulated by	antihypertensives
antihypertensives	selected by	renal function
renal function	assessed by	eGFR
eGFR	calculated from	creatinine
creatinine	influenced by	muscle mass
muscle mass	estimated by	body mass index
body mass index	predicts	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	linked to	mortality
mortality	reduced by	early intervention
early intervention	requires	timely referral
timely referral	depends on	primary care
primary care	monitors	kidney function
kidney function	monitored by	urinalysis
urinalysis	detects	proteinuria
proteinuria	indicates	kidney damage
kidney damage	progresses to	dialysis requirement
dialysis requirement	may be	peritoneal
peritoneal	offers	home autonomy
home autonomy	improves	mental health
mental health	assessed by	depression screening
depression screening	performed by	PHQ‑9
PHQ‑9	scores	guide therapy
therapy	may include	antidepressants
antidepressants	must consider	drug interactions
drug interactions	evaluated by	pharmacogenomics
pharmacogenomics	informs	dosing
dosing	tailored to	patient genetics
patient genetics	influence	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	affects	side effect profile
side effect profile	monitored by	follow‑up visits
follow‑up visits	scheduled	quarterly
