bone scan	can detect	early metastasis
early metastasis	improves	survival probability
survival probability	is a	prognostic indicator
prognostic indicator	guides	palliative care
palliative care	reduces	symptom burden
symptom burden	improves	quality of life
quality of life	is assessed by	patient‑reported outcomes
patient‑reported outcomes	inform	clinical trials
clinical trials	generate	evidence‑based guidelines
evidence‑based guidelines	recommend	imaging frequency
imaging frequency	affects	radiation exposure
radiation exposure	is monitored by	dose‑area product
dose‑area product	limits	cumulative dose
cumulative dose	reduces	secondary cancer risk
secondary cancer risk	is a	long‑term concern
long‑term concern	necessitates	risk‑benefit analysis
risk‑benefit analysis	informs	policy decisions
policy decisions	shape	reimbursement rates
reimbursement rates	influence	provider behavior
provider behavior	determines	imaging utilization

bone health education	increases	calcium intake
calcium intake	supports	bone mineralization
bone mineralization	strengthens	skeletal integrity
skeletal integrity	reduces	fall risk
fall risk	lowers	injury incidence
injury incidence	decreases	mortality rate
mortality rate	is a	population health metric
population health metric	guides	resource allocation
resource allocation	affects	imaging availability
imaging availability	determines	diagnostic timeliness
diagnostic timeliness	impacts	treatment efficacy
treatment efficacy	is measured by	remission rate
remission rate	predicts	long‑term survival
long‑term survival	is a	health outcome
health outcome	is used in	health technology assessment
health technology assessment	evaluates	cost‑effectiveness
cost‑effectiveness	informs	drug pricing
drug pricing	influences	patient access
patient access	determines	adherence rates
adherence rates	affect	disease progression
disease progression	is monitored by	serial imaging
serial imaging	requires	standardized protocols
standardized protocols	improve	inter‑observer agreement
inter‑observer agreement	enhances	clinical decision‑making
clinical decision‑making	reduces	unnecessary procedures
unnecessary procedures	lower	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	is tracked by	administrative data
administrative data	supports	predictive modeling
