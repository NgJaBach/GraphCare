nausea	treated with	antiemetics
antiemetics	are a type of	medication
medication	prescribed by	pharmacist
pharmacist	provides	medication counseling
medication counseling	improves	adherence
adherence	reduces	adverse events
adverse events	increase	readmission risk
readmission risk	predicts	mortality
mortality	associated with	age
age	correlates with	frailty
frailty	measured by	Fried criteria

cortisol	is a type of	corticosteroid
corticosteroid	dosage	determined by	severity
severity	graded by	clinical scoring
clinical scoring	includes	Pediatric Ear Infection Score
Pediatric Ear Infection Score	predicts	treatment success
treatment success	measured by	symptom resolution
symptom resolution	leads to	discharge
discharge	requires	follow‑up
follow‑up	scheduled by	primary care
primary care	monitors	recurrence
recurrence	may need	repeat therapy
repeat therapy	increases	drug exposure
drug exposure	raises	risk of toxicity
toxicity	monitored by	laboratory tests
laboratory tests	include	liver function
