cold preparations	are classified by	ATC code R01
ATC code R01	represents	respiratory system
respiratory system	includes	nasal passages
nasal passages	affected by	allergic rhinitis
allergic rhinitis	treated with	antihistamines
cold preparations	are sold as	over‑the‑counter
over‑the‑counter	allows	self‑medication
self‑medication	requires	patient education
patient education	reduces	misuse
misuse	leads to	adverse events
adverse events	include	drowsiness
drowsiness	caused by	antihistamines

drug metabolism	involves	cytochrome P450
cytochrome P450	metabolizes	many antihistamines
cold preparations	are contraindicated in	renal impairment
renal impairment	reduces	excretion
excretion	affects	drug clearance
drug clearance	influences	drug concentration
drug concentration	determines	efficacy
efficacy	predicts	symptom relief
symptom relief	improves	quality of life
quality of life	measured by	patient‑reported outcomes
patient‑reported outcomes	used in	clinical trials
clinical trials	assess	safety
clinical trials	assess	efficacy
cold preparations	are evaluated by	pharmacovigilance
pharmacovigilance	monitors	adverse drug reactions
adverse drug reactions	reported to	WHO VigiBase
WHO VigiBase	aggregates	global data
global data	informs	prescribing guidelines
prescribing guidelines	recommend	first‑line therapy
first‑line therapy	includes	antihistamines
antihistamines	have	first‑generation
first‑generation	cause	sedation
sedation	contraindicated in	elderly
elderly	have	increased sensitivity
cold preparations	also contain	mucolytics
mucolytics	break down	mucus
break down	reduces	sputum viscosity
sputum viscosity	affects	expectoration
expectoration	improves	airway clearance
airway clearance	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	predicts	readmission
readmission	associated with	poor outcomes
poor outcomes	linked to	mortality
mortality	predicted by	comorbidity index
comorbidity index	includes	chronic diseases
chronic diseases	include	COPD
COPD	exacerbated by	cold
cold	triggers	exacerbation
exacerbation	leads to	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	drives	resource allocation
resource allocation	informs	public health policy
public health policy	sets	vaccination recommendations
vaccination recommendations	reduce	cold incidence
