antipsoriatics	are	drugs
antipsoriatics	treat	psoriasis
psoriasis	is	chronic

methotrexate	is	immunosuppressant
cyclosporine	is	immunosuppressant
methotrexate	causes	hepatotoxicity
cyclosporine	causes	nephrotoxicity
biologics	cause	infusion reactions
infusion reactions	predict	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	increases	with comorbidities
comorbidities	include	cardiovascular disease
cardiovascular disease	increases	mortality
cardiovascular disease	increases	drug toxicity
drug toxicity	increases	adverse events
adverse events	increase	treatment discontinuation
treatment discontinuation	leads to	disease flare
disease flare	leads to	joint pain
joint pain	predicts	reduced quality of life
quality of life	predicts	depression
depression	predicts	suicide risk
suicide risk	predicts	mortality
antipsoriatics	require	monitoring
monitoring	includes	liver function tests
liver function tests	detect	hepatotoxicity
monitoring	includes	kidney function tests
kidney function tests	detect	nephrotoxicity
monitoring	includes	CBC
CBC	detects	cytopenia
cytopenia	predicts	infection risk
infection risk	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	mortality
antipsoriatics	are	prescription drugs
prescription drugs	require	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	affects	adherence
adherence	predicts	disease control
disease control	predicts	flare frequency
flare frequency	predicts	joint damage
joint damage	predicts	disability
disability	predicts	unemployment
unemployment	predicts	financial strain
financial strain	predicts	medication non‑adherence
medication non‑adherence	predicts	flare
flare	predicts	increased steroid use
steroid use	predicts	osteoporosis
osteoporosis	predicts	fracture risk
fracture risk	predicts	mortality
antipsoriatics	are	disease‑modifying
disease‑modifying	reduce	disease activity
disease activity	reduces	joint inflammation
joint inflammation	reduces	pain
pain	reduces	disability
disability	reduces	mortality
antipsoriatics	are	long‑term therapy
long‑term therapy	requires	risk‑benefit assessment
risk‑benefit assessment	includes	patient preference
patient preference	influences	drug choice
drug choice	influences	side‑effect profile
side‑effect profile	influences	adherence
adherence	influences	treatment outcome
treatment outcome	influences	quality of life
quality of life	influences	mental health
mental health	influences	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	influences	relapse
relapse	influences	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	influences	cost
cost	influences	access to therapy
access to therapy	influences	disease severity
disease severity	influences	mortality
mortality	influenced by	age
age	influences	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	influences	toxicity
toxicity	influences	adverse events
adverse events	influence	readmission
readmission	influences	mortality
mortality	influenced by	smoking
smoking	increases	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	increases	mortality
antipsoriatics	are	indicated for moderate‑to‑severe
moderate‑to‑severe	defined by	PASI score
PASI score	predicts	treatment response
treatment response	predicts	remission
remission	predicts	reduced mortality
reduced mortality	predicts	longer life expectancy
