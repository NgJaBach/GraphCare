vitamin K	is a	cofactor
vitamin K	activates	clotting factors
clotting factors	include	factor II
clotting factors	include	factor VII
clotting factors	include	factor IX
clotting factors	include	factor X
clotting factors	are needed for	coagulation
coagulation	prevents	hemorrhage
hemorrhage	increases	mortality
vitamin K	deficiency causes	bleeding
bleeding	leads to	anemia
anemia	predicts	readmission
vitamin K	is found in	leafy greens
leafy greens	are high in	folate
folate	reduces	cardiovascular risk
vitamin K	is absorbed	via bile
bile	is produced by	liver
liver	dysfunction leads to	coagulopathy
coagulopathy	requires	vitamin K therapy
vitamin K therapy	given as	injection
injection	preferred over	oral
oral	has	variable absorption
variable absorption	causes	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	improves	therapeutic outcome
vitamin K	is antagonized by	warfarin
warfarin	is a	anticoagulant
anticoagulant	used for	atrial fibrillation
atrial fibrillation	increases	stroke risk
stroke risk	mitigated by	anticoagulant
anticoagulant	monitored by	INR
INR	is calculated from	PT
PT	measures	clotting time
clotting time	predicts	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	mortality
vitamin K	is also a	vitamin
vitamin	classified as	fat‑soluble
fat‑soluble	stored in	adipose tissue
adipose tissue	releases	vitamin K
release	occurs during	fasting
fasting	increases	vitamin K levels
vitamin K	interacts with	antibiotics
antibiotics	reduce	gut flora
gut flora	synthesize	vitamin K
synthesis	decreases	vitamin K
decrease	leads to	subtherapeutic INR
subtherapeutic INR	causes	clotting
clotting	leads to	thrombosis
thrombosis	causes	embolism
embolism	predicts	mortality
vitamin K	used in	newborn screening
newborn screening	detects	hemophilia
hemophilia	requires	vitamin K
vitamin K	used in	surgical prophylaxis
surgical prophylaxis	reduces	postoperative bleeding
postoperative bleeding	reduces	transfusion
transfusion	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	predicts	ICU stay
ICU stay	predicts	readmission
vitamin K	is measured by	plasma level
plasma level	correlates with	dietary intake
dietary intake	predicts	cardiovascular health
cardiovascular health	predicts	mortality
vitamin K	is a	therapeutic target
therapeutic target	used for	osteoporosis
osteoporosis	increases	fracture risk
fracture risk	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	mortality
vitamin K	is a	biomarker
biomarker	indicates	liver function
liver function	predicts	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	affects	warfarin clearance
warfarin clearance	determines	dose
dose	affects	INR stability
INR stability	predicts	bleeding events
bleeding events	predict	readmission
vitamin K	is synthesized by	gut bacteria
gut bacteria	altered by	diet
diet	influences	microbiome
microbiome	influences	vitamin K
vitamin K	is a	co‑factor for	gamma‑carboxylation
gamma‑carboxylation	required for	protein C
protein C	is an	anticoagulant
anticoagulant	reduces	clot formation
clot formation	reduces	ischemic stroke
ischemic stroke	reduces	mortality
vitamin K	is a	component of	bone matrix
bone matrix	supports	bone strength
bone strength	reduces	fracture risk
fracture risk	reduces	mortality
vitamin K	is a	component of	vitamin K2
vitamin K2	found in	fermented foods
fermented foods	contain	probiotics
probiotics	improve	gut health
gut health	improves	vitamin K absorption
absorption	improves	coagulation
coagulation	improves	surgical outcomes
surgical outcomes	reduce	complications
complications	reduce	readmission
readmission	reduces	healthcare cost
