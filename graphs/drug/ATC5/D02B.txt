sunscreen	protects	skin
sunscreen	blocks	UV‑B
sunscreen	blocks	UVA
sunscreen	contains	zinc oxide
sunscreen	contains	titanium dioxide
sunscreen	contains	avobenzone
sunscreen	contains	octinoxate
sunscreen	contains	oxybenzone
sunscreen	contains	homosalate
sunscreen	contains	octocrylene
sunscreen	has	SPF
SPF	measures	UV‑B protection
SPF	correlates with	photostability
photostability	affects	efficacy
efficacy	predicts	skin‑cancer risk
skin‑cancer risk	predicts	melanoma
skin‑cancer risk	predicts	basal‑cell carcinoma
skin‑cancer risk	predicts	squamous‑cell carcinoma
sunscreen	is applied	topically
topical application	requires	reapplication
reapplication	recommended	every 2 hours
reapplication	recommended	after swimming
sunscreen	is tested	in vitro
in vitro testing	uses	UV‑spectrophotometry
UV‑spectrophotometry	measures	absorbance
absorbance	indicates	photoinhibition
photoinhibition	reduces	DNA damage
DNA damage	leads to	mutations
mutations	cause	carcinogenesis
sunscreen	is regulated	by FDA
FDA regulation	requires	safety data
safety data	includes	phototoxicity
phototoxicity	assessed	by skin‑patch test
skin‑patch test	detects	allergic contact dermatitis
allergic contact dermatitis	causes	erythema
erythema	indicates	inflammation
inflammation	increases	cytokine release
cytokine release	predicts	systemic inflammation
systemic inflammation	predicts	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	predicts	mortality
mortality	is outcome	for elderly
elderly	use	sunscreen
sunscreen	is formulated	for children
children	have	higher UV sensitivity
higher UV sensitivity	increases	sunburn risk
sunburn	causes	erythema
erythema	indicates	acute inflammation
acute inflammation	predicts	pain
pain	leads to	reduced outdoor activity
reduced outdoor activity	reduces	vitamin D synthesis
vitamin D synthesis	influences	bone health
bone health	predicts	osteoporosis
osteoporosis	predicts	fracture risk
fracture risk	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	readmission
readmission	is metric	for quality care
quality care	measured	by CMS
CMS measurement	uses	risk adjustment
risk adjustment	incorporates	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	increases	antibiotic use
antibiotic use	leads to	resistance
resistance	reduces	treatment efficacy
treatment efficacy	predicts	mortality
mortality	is outcome	for sepsis
sepsis	is triggered	by bacterial infection
bacterial infection	detected	by culture
culture	identifies	pathogen
pathogen	may be	MRSA
MRSA	requires	vancomycin
vancomycin	has	nephrotoxicity
nephrotoxicity	predicts	acute kidney injury
acute kidney injury	predicts	dialysis
dialysis	predicts	mortality
mortality	is outcome	for CKD
CKD	is risk factor	for cardiovascular disease
cardiovascular disease	is risk factor	for stroke
stroke	leads to	disability
disability	increases	caregiver burden
caregiver burden	predicts	depression
depression	predicts	suicide risk
suicide risk	predicts	mortality
mortality	is outcome	for mental illness
mental illness	treated	with antidepressants
antidepressants	may cause	weight gain
weight gain	increases	metabolic syndrome
metabolic syndrome	increases	insulin resistance
insulin resistance	leads to	type 2 diabetes
type 2 diabetes	increases	foot ulcer risk
foot ulcer risk	leads to	amputation
amputation	increases	mortality
mortality	is outcome	for peripheral artery disease
peripheral artery disease	treated	with statins
statins	reduce	LDL
LDL reduction	decreases	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	reduces	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	reduces	mortality
mortality	is outcome	for cardiovascular disease
cardiovascular disease	is prevented	by sunscreen
