decongestants	contraindicated	in pregnancy
antiallergics	contraindicated	in pregnancy
pseudoephedrine	is regulated	by DEA
loratadine	is metabolized	by CYP3A4
CYP3A4 inhibition	increases	loratadine levels
decongestants	increase	heart rate
antiallergics	reduce	allergic inflammation
decongestants	used in	flu treatment
antiallergics	used in	hay fever
decongestants	cause	insomnia
antiallergics	cause	dry mouth
decongestants	are available	OTC
antiallergics	are available	OTC
pseudoephedrine	is a	beta‑adrenergic agonist
beta‑adrenergic agonist	stimulates	adrenergic receptors
adrenergic receptor stimulation	leads to	bronchodilation
bronchodilation	helps	asthma patients
decongestants	may worsen	asthma
antiallergics	may worsen	asthma
decongestants	can be combined	with antihistamines
antiallergics	can be combined	with antihistamines
combined therapy	improves	symptom relief
decongestants	have	short half‑life
antiallergics	have	long half‑life
short half‑life	requires	frequent dosing
long half‑life	allows	once‑daily dosing
decongestants	may cause	rebound congestion
rebound congestion	leads to	chronic use
chronic use	increases	risk of dependency
antiallergics	are non‑sedating
non‑sedating	preferred	for daytime use
decongestants	can be used	intranasally
intranasal use	reduces	systemic exposure
intranasal use	may cause	nasal irritation
antiallergics	can be used	topically
topical use	reduces	systemic side effects
decongestants	are contraindicated	in heart disease
antiallergics	are contraindicated	in liver disease
pseudoephedrine	is metabolized	by MAO
MAO inhibition	increases	pseudoephedrine toxicity
loratadine	is excreted	renally
renal impairment	reduces	loratadine clearance
decongestants	may interact	with MAO inhibitors
antiallergics	may interact	with CYP3A4 inhibitors
CYP3A4 inhibitors	increase	loratadine concentration
decongestants	can cause	tachycardia
tachycardia	predicts	cardiovascular risk
antiallergics	reduce	histamine‑mediated itching
histamine‑mediated itching	improves	quality of life
decongestants	are used	in combination therapy
antiallergics	are used	in combination therapy
combination therapy	reduces	medication burden
decongestants	are contraindicated	in glaucoma
antiallergics	are contraindicated	in glaucoma
pseudoephedrine	increases	intraocular pressure
loratadine	has	low ocular side effects
decongestants	may cause	anxiety
anxiety	predicts	poor adherence
antiallergics	are safe	in pregnancy category B
pregnancy category B	indicates	low risk
decongestants	are contraindicated	in lactation
antiallergics	are safe	in lactation
decongestants	can be used	in pediatric patients
antiallergics	can be used	in pediatric patients
pediatric use	requires	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	based on	weight
decongestants	may cause	urinary retention
urinary retention	predicts	hospitalization
antiallergics	may cause	hepatic enzyme induction
hepatic enzyme induction	reduces	drug efficacy
decongestants	are metabolized	by CYP2D6
CYP2D6 polymorphism	affects	pseudoephedrine metabolism
antiallergics	are metabolized	by CYP3A4
CYP3A4 polymorphism	affects	loratadine metabolism
decongestants	can be used	in chronic sinusitis
antiallergics	can be used	in chronic sinusitis
chronic sinusitis	predicts	long‑term medication use
long‑term medication use	predicts	readmission risk
decongestants	may interact	with beta‑blockers
beta‑blocker interaction	reduces	decongestant efficacy
antiallergics	may interact	with antihypertensives
antihypertensive interaction	increases	blood pressure variability
decongestants	can cause	rebound nasal congestion
rebound congestion	leads to	increased medication use
increased medication use	predicts	medication‑related complications
decongestants	are monitored	for cardiovascular events
