digestive enzymes	are produced by	pancreas
pancreas	secretes	lipase
pancreas	secretes	amylase
pancreas	secretes	protease
lipase	digests	fat
amylase	digests	carbohydrate
protease	digests	protein
digestion	occurs in	small intestine
small intestine	absorbs	glucose
small intestine	absorbs	amino acids
small intestine	absorbs	fatty acids
bile	emulsifies	fat
bile	is produced by	liver
liver	stores	bile
pancreatic insufficiency	causes	steatorrhea
steatorrhea	indicates	fat malabsorption
malabsorption	leads to	vitamin deficiency
vitamin deficiency	includes	vitamin A
vitamin deficiency	includes	vitamin D
vitamin deficiency	includes	vitamin E
vitamin deficiency	includes	vitamin K
cystic fibrosis	causes	pancreatic insufficiency
pancreatic insufficiency	increases	risk of	diabetes
diabetes	is type	type 2
type 2 diabetes	is associated with	obesity
obesity	is linked to	metabolic syndrome
metabolic syndrome	increases	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	includes	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	is driven by	systemic inflammation
systemic inflammation	is mediated by	cytokines
cytokines	include	TNF‑α
cytokines	include	IL‑6
TNF‑α	promotes	insulin resistance
IL‑6	promotes	insulin resistance
insulin resistance	leads to	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	causes	glycation
glycation	damages	endothelial cells
endothelial damage	contributes to	atherosclerosis
bile acids	regulate	gut microbiota
gut microbiota	produce	short‑chain fatty acids
short‑chain fatty acids	include	butyrate
butyrate	nourishes	colonocytes
colonocytes	maintain	gut barrier
gut barrier	integrity is controlled by	tight junctions
tight junctions	are regulated by	zonulin
zonulin	increases	gut permeability
gut permeability	allows	endotoxin
endotoxin	triggers	inflammation
inflammation	exacerbates	metabolic syndrome
metabolic syndrome	predisposes to	colorectal cancer
colorectal cancer	is screened by	colonoscopy
colonoscopy	detects	colon polyps
colon polyps	can be removed by	polypectomy
polypectomy	reduces	cancer risk
lactase	digests	lactose
lactase deficiency	causes	lactose intolerance
lactose intolerance	results in	bloating
bloating	is a symptom of	small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth	is treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	alter	microbiome
microbiome	influences	gut‑brain axis
gut‑brain axis	modulates	mood
mood	affects	appetite
appetite	is regulated by	ghrelin
ghrelin	stimulates	hunger
hunger	drives	food intake
food intake	determines	energy balance
energy balance	determines	weight
weight	is a factor in	obesity
obesity	is treated by	bariatric surgery
bariatric surgery	includes	gastric bypass
gastric bypass	reduces	nutrient absorption
reduced absorption	can cause	iron deficiency
iron deficiency	leads to	anemia
anemia	presents with	fatigue
fatigue	impairs	quality of life
quality of life	is measured by	patient‑reported outcomes
patient‑reported outcomes	predict	readmission risk
readmission risk	is higher in	post‑bariatric patients
post‑bariatric patients	require	vitamin supplementation
vitamin supplementation	includes	vitamin B12
vitamin B12	is absorbed in	ileum
ileum	is affected by	Crohn disease
Crohn disease	causes	malabsorption
malabsorption	leads to	protein‑energy wasting
protein‑energy wasting	predicts	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	early nutrition
early nutrition	is guided by	nutritional assessment
nutritional assessment	uses	Subjective Global Assessment
Subjective Global Assessment	predicts	hospital outcomes
hospital outcomes	include	length of stay
length of stay	correlates with	cost
cost	is a factor in	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	is influenced by	disease severity
disease severity	is measured by	clinical scoring
clinical scoring	informs	treatment decisions
treatment decisions	affect	survival
survival	is improved by	early intervention
early intervention	relies on	diagnostic imaging
diagnostic imaging	includes	CT scan
