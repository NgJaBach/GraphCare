gonadotropins	are	hormones
gonadotropins	stimulate	ovulation
ovulation	is	reproductive process
ovulation stimulants	include	clomiphene
clomiphene	is	selective estrogen receptor modulator
clomiphene	used for	infertility
infertility	can be	anovulatory
anovulatory	condition	amenorrhea
amenorrhea	may cause	subfertility
gonadotropins	include	FSH
gonadotropins	include	LH
FSH	promotes	follicle growth
LH	triggers	ovulation
follicle growth	leads to	estrogen production
estrogen production	supports	endometrial thickening
endometrial thickening	is	implantation site
implantation	is	pregnancy initiation
ovulation stimulants	can cause	ovarian hyperstimulation
ovarian hyperstimulation	increases	risk of OHSS
OHSS	manifests as	abdominal pain
abdominal pain	may require	hospitalization
hospitalization	indicates	severe OHSS
severe OHSS	associated with	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	can lead to	cardiac arrhythmia
cardiac arrhythmia	requires	emergency care
ovulation stimulants	may cause	mood changes
mood changes	include	anxiety
anxiety	can affect	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	influences	pregnancy success
pregnancy success	measured by	live birth rate
live birth rate	predicts	long‑term child health
child health	influenced by	maternal hormone levels
maternal hormone levels	altered by	gonadotropin therapy
gonadotropin therapy	requires	dosage adjustment
dosage adjustment	guided by	serum estradiol
serum estradiol	measured in	blood test
blood test	informs	treatment plan
treatment plan	includes	monitoring schedule
monitoring schedule	reduces	risk of complications
complications	include	ectopic pregnancy
ectopic pregnancy	detected by	beta‑hCG
beta‑hCG	measured in	urine test
urine test	used for	early pregnancy detection
early pregnancy detection	improves	outcomes
outcomes	measured by	miscarriage rate
miscarriage rate	influenced by	ovarian reserve
ovarian reserve	assessed by	AMH
AMH	measured in	serum
serum	contains	anti‑Müllerian hormone
anti‑Müllerian hormone	predicts	response to stimulation
response to stimulation	predicts	cycle cancellation
cycle cancellation	reduces	patient stress
patient stress	lowers	depression risk
depression risk	impacts	overall health
overall health	affects	medication metabolism
medication metabolism	varies by	CYP450
CYP450	metabolizes	clomiphene
clomiphene	metabolized into	active metabolites
active metabolites	bind to	estrogen receptors
estrogen receptors	located in	uterus
uterus	prepares for	implantation
implantation	requires	progesterone
progesterone	produced by	corpus luteum
corpus luteum	forms after	ovulation
ovulation	triggered by	LH surge
LH surge	induced by	GnRH
GnRH	secreted by	hypothalamus
hypothalamus	regulates	reproductive axis
reproductive axis	includes	pituitary
pituitary	releases	gonadotropins
gonadotropins	include	hMG
hMG	contains	FSH and LH
FSH	promotes	follicular maturation
follicular maturation	leads to	dominant follicle
dominant follicle	secretes	estradiol
estradiol	signals	endometrial receptivity
endometrial receptivity	critical for	embryo implantation
embryo implantation	failure leads to	infertility
infertility	treated with	assisted reproductive technology
assisted reproductive technology	includes	IVF
IVF	requires	ovarian stimulation
ovarian stimulation	uses	gonadotropins
gonadotropins	dosage based on	body mass index
body mass index	correlates with	drug clearance
drug clearance	affects	serum drug levels
serum drug levels	influence	side effect profile
side effect profile	includes	hot flashes
hot flashes	managed by	antihistamines
antihistamines	reduce	vasomotor symptoms
vasomotor symptoms	improve	quality of life
quality of life	predicts	treatment satisfaction
treatment satisfaction	linked to	adherence
adherence	determines	therapeutic outcome
therapeutic outcome	measured by	pregnancy rate
pregnancy rate	influenced by	age
age	affects	ovarian reserve
ovarian reserve	measured by	antral follicle count
antral follicle count	obtained via	ultrasound
ultrasound	visualizes	ovarian follicles
ovarian follicles	indicate	fertility potential
