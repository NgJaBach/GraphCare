alkylating agents	are a	drug class
alkylating agents	treat	cancer
alkylating agents	cause	DNA damage
DNA damage	leads to	apoptosis
alkylating agents	induce	myelosuppression
myelosuppression	increases	infection risk
infection risk	leads to	sepsis
alkylating agents	cause	alopecia
alopecia	causes	patient distress
patient distress	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	predicts	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	affects	survival rate
survival rate	predicts	overall mortality
alkylating agents	used in	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	scheduled	cycles
cycles	determine	cumulative dose
cumulative dose	correlates with	toxicity
toxicity	measured by	grade 3/4 events
grade 3/4 events	predict	readmission
readmission	increases	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	predicts	resource allocation
resource allocation	influences	hospital staffing
hospital staffing	affects	patient wait time
patient wait time	predicts	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	correlates with	hospital rating
hospital rating	influences	referral patterns
referral patterns	affect	patient volume
patient volume	predicts	bed occupancy
bed occupancy	determines	discharge timing
discharge timing	influences	readmission risk
readmission risk	associated with	comorbidity index
comorbidity index	includes	diabetes
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	leads to	antibiotic use
antibiotic use	causes	resistance
resistance	predicts	treatment failure
treatment failure	results in	disease progression
disease progression	measured by	tumor burden
tumor burden	correlates with	prognosis
prognosis	predicts	survival
survival	influenced by	age
age	affects	pharmacokinetics
pharmacokinetics	determine	drug clearance
drug clearance	influences	toxicity
toxicity	measured by	liver enzymes
liver enzymes	indicate	hepatic dysfunction
hepatic dysfunction	predicts	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	required for	elderly
elderly	have	reduced renal function
renal function	affects	drug excretion
drug excretion	determines	drug accumulation
drug accumulation	leads to	neurotoxicity
neurotoxicity	manifests as	neuropathy
neuropathy	reduces	mobility
mobility	predicts	fall risk
fall risk	increases	hospitalization
hospitalization	leads to	delirium
delirium	associated with	longer stay
longer stay	predicts	cost escalation
cost escalation	drives	insurance premiums
insurance premiums	affect	patient access
patient access	influences	treatment initiation
treatment initiation	delays	disease control
disease control	measured by	remission rate
remission rate	predicts	relapse
relapse	requires	second-line therapy
second-line therapy	includes	targeted agents
targeted agents	used after	alkylating agents
alkylating agents	cause	cross-resistance
cross-resistance	reduces	efficacy
efficacy	measured by	progression-free survival
progression-free survival	predicts	overall survival
overall survival	influenced by	performance status
performance status	assessed by	ECOG
ECOG	predicts	treatment choice
treatment choice	determines	side effect profile
side effect profile	includes	nausea
nausea	treated with	antiemetics
antiemetics	reduce	treatment discontinuation
treatment discontinuation	leads to	suboptimal dosing
suboptimal dosing	results in	lower response
lower response	associated with	poor prognosis
poor prognosis	increases	palliative care need
palliative care need	affects	caregiver burden
caregiver burden	predicts	caregiver depression
caregiver depression	reduces	home care quality
home care quality	influences	readmission
readmission	correlates with	social support
social support	measured by	support score
support score	predicts	adherence
adherence	determines	treatment outcome
treatment outcome	measured by	response rate
response rate	predicts	survival
survival	influenced by	tumor genetics
tumor genetics	include	BRCA mutation
BRCA mutation	increases	sensitivity to alkylating agents
sensitivity	leads to	higher response
higher response	reduces	recurrence
recurrence	predicts	second-line therapy
second-line therapy	may include	immunotherapy
