nasal decongestants	are a	drug
nasal decongestants	act on	adrenergic receptors
adrenergic receptors	are located on	blood vessels
blood vessels	regulate	blood pressure
nasal decongestants	cause	vasoconstriction
vasoconstriction	reduces	nasal congestion
nasal congestion	improves	breathing
nasal decongestants	are taken	orally
oral administration	leads to	systemic absorption
systemic absorption	increases	plasma concentration
plasma concentration	correlates with	side effects
nasal decongestants	may cause	tachycardia
tachycardia	indicates	sympathetic activation
sympathetic activation	elevates	heart rate
elevated heart rate	increases	cardiac workload
cardiac workload	risks	arrhythmias
arrhythmias	predict	mortality
nasal decongestants	may cause	hypertension
hypertension	is a	risk factor
risk factor	predicts	cardiovascular events
cardiovascular events	lead to	readmission
readmission	indicates	poor prognosis
nasal decongestants	may cause	insomnia
insomnia	reduces	sleep quality
sleep quality	affects	immune function
immune function	influences	infection risk
infection risk	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	healthcare cost
nasal decongestants	may cause	nausea
nausea	leads to	poor adherence
poor adherence	results in	treatment failure
treatment failure	causes	disease progression
disease progression	predicts	mortality
nasal decongestants	may cause	headache
headache	indicates	central nervous system effect
central nervous system effect	can worsen	migraine
migraine	increases	emergency visits
emergency visits	predict	readmission
nasal decongestants	may cause	dry mouth
dry mouth	leads to	dental caries
dental caries	increase	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	correlates with	socioeconomic status
socioeconomic status	predicts	medication adherence
medication adherence	affects	treatment outcome
treatment outcome	influences	mortality
nasal decongestants	may cause	urinary retention
urinary retention	indicates	anticholinergic effect
anticholinergic effect	associated with	cognitive decline
cognitive decline	predicts	institutionalization
institutionalization	increases	mortality risk
nasal decongestants	may cause	rebound congestion
rebound congestion	leads to	prolonged use
prolonged use	raises	drug toxicity
drug toxicity	predicts	adverse events
adverse events	increase	readmission
nasal decongestants	may interact with	beta blockers
beta blockers	reduce	heart rate
reduced heart rate	counteracts	tachycardia
counteracts	decreases	arrhythmia risk
arrhythmia risk	lowers	mortality
nasal decongestants	may interact with	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	lower	blood pressure
lower blood pressure	mitigates	hypertension risk
hypertension risk	reduces	cardiovascular events
cardiovascular events	lower	readmission
nasal decongestants	may interact with	SSRIs
SSRIs	increase	serotonin
serotonin	can cause	serotonin syndrome
serotonin syndrome	leads to	ICU admission
ICU admission	predicts	mortality
nasal decongestants	may interact with	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	increase	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	causes	hospitalization
hospitalization	raises	cost
cost	predicts	medication discontinuation
medication discontinuation	results in	disease relapse
disease relapse	predicts	mortality
nasal decongestants	are contraindicated in	pregnancy
pregnancy	increases	fetal risk
fetal risk	leads to	neonatal complications
neonatal complications	predict	infant mortality
nasal decongestants	are contraindicated in	children
children	have	higher sensitivity
higher sensitivity	increases	adverse events
adverse events	predict	readmission
nasal decongestants	are contraindicated in	renal impairment
renal impairment	reduces	drug clearance
reduced clearance	raises	toxicity
toxicity	predicts	mortality
nasal decongestants	are contraindicated in	hepatic impairment
hepatic impairment	impairs	metabolism
impaired metabolism	increases	plasma levels
plasma levels	correlate with	side effects
side effects	predict	treatment failure
treatment failure	leads to	disease progression
disease progression	predicts	mortality
nasal decongestants	are associated with	weight gain
weight gain	increases	obesity
obesity	predicts	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	raises	mortality
