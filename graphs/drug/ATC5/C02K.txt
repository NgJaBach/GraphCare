antihypertensives	belong to	ATC
ATC	classifies	drugs
antihypertensives	treat	hypertension
hypertension	causes	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	medication adherence
medication adherence	measured by	pharmacy refill
pharmacy refill	predicts	readmission
readmission	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	improves	patient satisfaction
antihypertensives	include	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	reduce	blood pressure
blood pressure	correlates with	stroke risk
stroke risk	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	limits	treatment access
treatment access	affects	disease control
disease control	measured by	BP variability
BP variability	predicts	renal damage
renal damage	leads to	chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease	worsens	mortality
mortality	mitigated by	beta blockers
beta blockers	block	sympathetic tone
sympathetic tone	reduces	heart rate
heart rate	associated with	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	increases	sudden death
sudden death	prevented by	calcium channel blockers
calcium channel blockers	inhibit	calcium influx
calcium influx	lowers	vascular resistance
vascular resistance	decreases	peripheral edema
peripheral edema	improves	exercise tolerance
exercise tolerance	predicts	functional status
functional status	linked to	frailty
frailty	predicts	readmission
readmission	tracked by	hospital readmission rate
hospital readmission rate	used in	quality metrics
quality metrics	influence	reimbursement
reimbursement	affects	drug formulary
drug formulary	determines	drug availability
drug availability	impacts	patient choice
patient choice	drives	adherence
adherence	measured by	pill count
pill count	predicts	therapeutic outcome
therapeutic outcome	reflected in	blood pressure control
blood pressure control	reduces	end‑organ damage
end‑organ damage	includes	left ventricular hypertrophy
left ventricular hypertrophy	predicts	heart failure
heart failure	treated with	diuretics
diuretics	reduce	fluid overload
fluid overload	improves	dyspnea
dyspnea	improves	exercise capacity
exercise capacity	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	mitigated by	statins
statins	lower	LDL cholesterol
LDL cholesterol	reduces	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	leads to	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	treated with	nitrates
nitrates	relieve	angina
angina	indicates	ischemia
ischemia	predicts	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	treated with	antiplatelets
antiplatelets	prevent	clot formation
clot formation	reduces	stroke
stroke	causes	disability
disability	measured by	ADL score
ADL score	predicts	readmission
readmission	associated with	socioeconomic status
socioeconomic status	influences	medication cost
medication cost	affects	adherence
adherence	improves	blood pressure variability
blood pressure variability	predicts	target organ damage
target organ damage	includes	retinopathy
retinopathy	leads to	vision loss
vision loss	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	measured by	SF‑36
SF‑36	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	age
age	correlates with	frailty
frailty	predicts	falls
falls	increase	hospitalization
hospitalization	leads to	polypharmacy
polypharmacy	increases	drug interactions
drug interactions	reduce	efficacy
efficacy	measured by	BP reduction
BP reduction	predicts	cardiovascular events
cardiovascular events	include	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	treated with	antiarrhythmics
antiarrhythmics	have	proarrhythmic risk
proarrhythmic risk	mitigated by	ECG monitoring
ECG monitoring	predicts	QT prolongation
QT prolongation	leads to	torsades
torsades	treated with	magnesium
magnesium	reduces	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	reduces	mortality
mortality	influenced by	gender
gender	affects	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	determines	dosing
