urologicals	are	medical procedures
urologicals	treat	urinary tract disorders
urologicals	include	cystoscopy
cystoscopy	visualizes	bladder
cystoscopy	detects	tumors
cystoscopy	uses	endoscope
endoscope	is	flexible
flexible	endoscope	allows	urethra
urethra	is	urinary tract
urinary tract	carries	urine
urinary tract	originates	kidneys
kidneys	filter	blood
blood	contains	waste
waste	excreted	urine
urine	passes	bladder
bladder	stores	urine
urine	expelled	urethra
urologicals	include	ureteroscopy
ureteroscopy	examines	ureters
ureters	connect	kidneys
kidneys	produce	urine
ureteroscopy	detects	stones
stones	cause	pain
pain	leads	emergency
urologicals	include	prostatectomy
prostatectomy	removes	prostate
prostate	enlarges	in BPH
BPH	causes	urinary retention
urinary retention	requires	catheter
catheter	inserted	urethra
urethra	is	narrow
narrow	urethra	causes	infection
infection	treated	antibiotics
antibiotics	prescribed	urologicals
urologicals	include	lithotripsy
lithotripsy	breaks	stones
stones	form	calcium oxalate
calcium oxalate	is	common
common	stone	type	calcium phosphate
calcium phosphate	forms	in urine
urine	pH	affects	stone
stone	size	determines	treatment
treatment	may	be	surgery
surgery	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	is	general
general	anesthesia	risks	hypotension
hypotension	leads	to	organ failure
organ failure	increases	mortality
mortality	predicted	by	risk score
risk score	includes	age
age	is	risk factor
risk factor	includes	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	increases	readmission
readmission	predicted	by	discharge plan
discharge plan	includes	follow‑up
follow‑up	scheduled	by	clinic
clinic	monitors	symptoms
symptoms	indicate	recurrence
recurrence	leads	to	re‑intervention
re‑intervention	increases	cost
cost	affects	insurance
insurance	determines	coverage
coverage	affects	adherence
adherence	predicts	outcome
outcome	measured	by	quality of life
quality of life	assessed	by	questionnaire
questionnaire	includes	pain score
pain score	guides	analgesic
analgesic	prescribed	opioid
opioid	risk	dependence
dependence	leads	to	withdrawal
withdrawal	managed	by	taper
taper	planned	by	physician
physician	monitors	renal function
renal function	measured	by	eGFR
eGFR	declines	with	age
age	increases	risk	kidney disease
kidney disease	requires	dialysis
dialysis	performed	in	hospital
hospital	provides	care
care	includes	nutrition
nutrition	affects	healing
healing	influences	recovery
recovery	measured	by	time to discharge
time to discharge	predicts	readmission
readmission	reduces	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	linked	to	outcomes
outcomes	improved	with	multidisciplinary
multidisciplinary	includes	surgeon
surgeon	collaborates	with	anesthesiologist
anesthesiologist	monitors	vitals
vitals	recorded	in	EMR
EMR	used	for	predictive modeling
predictive modeling	identifies	high‑risk
high‑risk	patients	receive	prophylaxis
prophylaxis	reduces	complications
complications	lower	mortality
mortality	decreased	by	early intervention
