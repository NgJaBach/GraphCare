potassium supplements	are a	drug
potassium supplements	treat	hypokalemia
hypokalemia	causes	muscle weakness
muscle weakness	leads to	fatigue
fatigue	predicts	readmission
potassium supplements	improve	cardiac conduction
cardiac conduction	reduces	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	increases	mortality
potassium supplements	reduce	mortality
potassium supplements	used in	ICU
ICU	has	high mortality
potassium supplements	are prescribed	by	cardiologist
cardiologist	monitors	serum potassium
serum potassium	measured by	blood test
blood test	detects	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	predicts	renal failure
renal failure	leads to	dialysis
dialysis	increases	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	readmission
potassium supplements	available	orally
potassium supplements	available	intravenously
intravenously	used in	emergency
emergency	requires	rapid correction
rapid correction	reduces	cardiac arrest
cardiac arrest	increases	mortality
potassium supplements	contraindicated	in	hyperkalemia
hyperkalemia	causes	ventricular fibrillation
ventricular fibrillation	leads to	sudden death
sudden death	increases	mortality
potassium supplements	cause	gastrointestinal upset
gastrointestinal upset	leads to	poor adherence
poor adherence	predicts	treatment failure
treatment failure	increases	readmission
potassium supplements	interact	with	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	increase	serum potassium
serum potassium	monitored	by	pharmacist
pharmacist	reviews	medication list
medication list	identifies	drug interactions
drug interactions	predict	adverse events
adverse events	increase	readmission
potassium supplements	have	half‑life
half‑life	influences	dosing frequency
dosing frequency	affects	adherence
adherence	predicts	clinical outcome
clinical outcome	includes	mortality
clinical outcome	includes	readmission
potassium supplements	are classified	as	electrolyte
electrolyte	is a	nutrient
nutrient	required	for	muscle function
muscle function	essential	for	mobility
mobility	predicts	fall risk
fall risk	increases	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	readmission
potassium supplements	are covered	by	insurance
insurance coverage	affects	cost
cost	influences	adherence
adherence	predicts	outcome
potassium supplements	are listed	in	drug database
drug database	used by	clinical decision support
clinical decision support	alerts	for	hyperkalemia
hyperkalemia	triggers	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	reduces	adverse events
adverse events	reduce	readmission
potassium supplements	are stored	at	room temperature
room temperature	ensures	stability
stability	affects	efficacy
efficacy	predicts	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	mortality
mortality	is a	key outcome
key outcome	used in	risk scoring
risk scoring	informs	discharge planning
discharge planning	reduces	readmission
readmission	is a	quality metric
quality metric	drives	hospital reimbursement
hospital reimbursement	influences	resource allocation
resource allocation	affects	staffing
staffing	impacts	patient monitoring
patient monitoring	detects	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	leads to	potassium supplementation
potassium supplementation	is guided	by	guidelines
guidelines	recommend	target range
target range	set at	3.5–5.0 mmol/L
3.5–5.0 mmol/L	is	normal
normal	prevents	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	increases	mortality
mortality	is	outcome
outcome	used in	predictive modeling
predictive modeling	informs	clinical pathways
clinical pathways	include	potassium monitoring
potassium monitoring	reduces	adverse events
adverse events	reduce	readmission
readmission	is	secondary outcome
secondary outcome	used in	value‑based care
value‑based care	rewards	low readmission
low readmission	encourages	guideline adherence
guideline adherence	improves	patient safety
patient safety	reduces	mortality
mortality	is	primary outcome
primary outcome	drives	policy
policy	shapes	potassium supplement availability
