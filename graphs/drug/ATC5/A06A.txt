drugs for constipation	treat	constipation
drugs for constipation	include	laxatives
laxatives	are	medications
laxatives	act on	gastrointestinal tract
laxatives	increase	bowel motility
laxatives	reduce	stool hardness
laxatives	can be	bulk-forming
bulk‑forming laxatives	contain	psyllium
psyllium	is	fiber
fiber	promotes	stool bulk
bulk‑forming laxatives	require	water intake
water intake	improves	laxative efficacy
laxatives	can be	osmotic
osmotic laxatives	include	polyethylene glycol
polyethylene glycol	is	non‑absorbable
non‑absorbable	draws	water into colon
water in colon	softens	stool
osmotic laxatives	may cause	bloating
laxatives	can be	stimulant
stimulant laxatives	include	senna
senna	contains	anthraquinones
anthraquinones	stimulate	colonic muscle
colonic muscle	increases	peristalsis
peristalsis	facilitates	stool passage
stimulant laxatives	may cause	abdominal cramps
laxatives	can be	stool softeners
stool softeners	include	docusate sodium
docusate sodium	is	surfactant
surfactant	reduces	surface tension
reduced surface tension	softens	stool
laxatives	can be	lubricants
lubricants	include	mineral oil
mineral oil	coats	stool
coated stool	eases	passage
mineral oil	may cause	steatorrhea
laxatives	can be	prescription
prescription laxatives	require	physician order
physician order	ensures	appropriate use
appropriate use	reduces	adverse events
laxatives	may cause	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	leads to	dehydration
dehydration	increases	kidney injury risk
kidney injury risk	predicts	readmission
readmission	indicates	treatment failure
treatment failure	predicts	mortality
mortality	associated with	severe constipation
severe constipation	linked to	fecal impaction
fecal impaction	increases	infection risk
infection risk	predicts	ICU admission
ICU admission	predicts	mortality
laxatives	may interact	with opioids
opioids	cause	constipation
constipation	worsens	opioid analgesia
opioid‑related constipation	predicts	prolonged stay
prolonged stay	predicts	readmission
readmission	increases	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	predicts	resource utilization
resource utilization	informs	budgeting
budgeting	guides	drug formulary
drug formulary	includes	cost‑effective laxatives
cost‑effective laxatives	reduce	out‑of‑pocket expense
out‑of‑pocket expense	improves	adherence
adherence	predicts	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	mortality
mortality	decreases	hospital burden
hospital burden	predicts	staffing needs
staffing needs	influence	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	measured by	quality metrics
quality metrics	used for	reimbursement
reimbursement	affects	drug availability
drug availability	impacts	treatment choice
treatment choice	influences	side‑effect profile
side‑effect profile	affects	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	predicts	adherence
adherence	reduces	relapse
relapse	predicts	readmission
readmission	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	modulated by	age
age	correlates with	constipation severity
constipation severity	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	associated with	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	constipation risk
constipation risk	predicts	cardiovascular events
cardiovascular events	predict	mortality
mortality	influenced by	smoking status
smoking status	affects	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	alters	laxative efficacy
laxative efficacy	predicts	symptom relief
symptom relief	reduces	anxiety
anxiety	lowers	constipation recurrence
constipation recurrence	predicts	long‑term morbidity
long‑term morbidity	correlates with	frailty
frailty	predicts	mortality
mortality	linked to	nutritional status
nutritional status	influenced by	fiber intake
fiber intake	promotes	bowel health
bowel health	reduces	constipation
constipation	improves	quality of life
quality of life	predicts	overall survival
