blood	is a	biological fluid
blood	contains	red blood cells
blood	contains	white blood cells
blood	contains	platelets
blood	contains	plasma
red blood cells	carry	oxygen
white blood cells	fight	infection
platelets	clot	blood
plasma	transports	nutrients
plasma	contains	clotting factors
clotting factors	initiate	coagulation
coagulation	prevents	hemorrhage
blood	is collected	from donor
donor	must	be screened
screening	checks	infectious diseases
infectious diseases	include	HIV
infectious diseases	include	hepatitis B
infectious diseases	include	hepatitis C
blood	is processed	into components
components	include	red cell concentrate
components	include	platelet concentrate
components	include	plasma fraction
red cell concentrate	used for	anemia
platelet concentrate	used for	thrombocytopenia
plasma fraction	used for	clotting disorders
plasma fraction	contains	factor VIII
factor VIII	treats	hemophilia A
factor IX	treats	hemophilia B
factor IX	found in	plasma fraction
plasma fraction	used for	immune globulin
immune globulin	treats	immunodeficiency
immune globulin	derived from	plasma
blood	stored	at 4°C
storage	limits	bacterial growth
storage	requires	refrigeration
blood	shelf life	42 days
platelets	shelf life	5 days
red cells	shelf life	42 days
plasma	shelf life	1 year
blood	transfused	into patient
transfusion	risks	transfusion reactions
transfusion reactions	include	febrile non-hemolytic
transfusion reactions	include	allergic
transfusion reactions	include	hemolytic
hemolytic reaction	caused by	ABO mismatch
ABO mismatch	leads to	hemolysis
hemolysis	causes	renal failure
transfusion	monitored	by hemoglobin
hemoglobin	indicates	oxygen carrying capacity
oxygen carrying capacity	measured by	pulse oximetry
pulse oximetry	measures	SpO2
SpO2	indicates	tissue oxygenation
tissue oxygenation	critical for	organ function
organ function	assessed by	creatinine
creatinine	indicates	kidney function
kidney function	impaired by	anemia
anemia	treated with	iron supplementation
iron supplementation	delivered as	oral iron
oral iron	absorbed in	duodenum
duodenum	requires	gastric acid
gastric acid	reduced by	proton pump inhibitors
proton pump inhibitors	reduce	iron absorption
iron absorption	increased by	vitamin C
vitamin C	sourced from	citrus fruits
citrus fruits	contain	vitamin C
vitamin C	enhances	iron bioavailability
iron bioavailability	affects	anemia resolution
anemia resolution	improves	exercise tolerance
exercise tolerance	measured by	VO2 max
VO2 max	predicts	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	mitigated by	statins
statins	lower	LDL cholesterol
LDL cholesterol	associated with	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	leads to	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	treated with	reperfusion therapy
reperfusion therapy	includes	PCI
PCI	requires	antiplatelet therapy
antiplatelet therapy	includes	aspirin
aspirin	inhibits	COX-1
COX-1	reduces	thromboxane A2
thromboxane A2	promotes	platelet aggregation
platelet aggregation	prevents	clot dissolution
clot dissolution	facilitated by	fibrinolysis
fibrinolysis	mediated by	plasmin
plasmin	activated from	plasminogen
plasminogen	present in	plasma
plasma	contains	antithrombin
antithrombin	inhibits	thrombin
thrombin	converts	fibrinogen to fibrin
fibrin	forms	stable clot
stable clot	essential for	wound healing
wound healing	requires	collagen synthesis
collagen synthesis	stimulated by	vitamin C
vitamin C	also required for	immune function
immune function	compromised by	immunosuppressants
immunosuppressants	used in	transplant rejection
transplant rejection	prevented by	tacrolimus
tacrolimus	inhibits	calcineurin
calcineurin	activates	NFAT
NFAT	drives	T‑cell activation
