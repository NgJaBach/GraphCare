anti‑acne preparations	are	topical
anti‑acne preparations	treat	acne
acne	causes	inflammation
inflammation	leads to	redness
redness	indicates	bacterial infection
bacterial infection	often involves	Propionibacterium acnes
Propionibacterium acnes	is	gram‑positive
gram‑positive	bacteria	produce	lipase
lipase	breaks down	sebum
sebum	accumulates	follicular plugs
follicular plugs	cause	comedones
comedones	are	blackheads
blackheads	are	open comedones
open comedones	can become	inflamed
inflamed lesions	may develop	cysts
cysts	are	deep acne lesions
deep acne lesions	increase	scarring risk
scarring risk	is	cosmetic concern
cosmetic concern	drives	patient adherence
patient adherence	affects	treatment outcome
treatment outcome	predicts	relapse risk
relapse risk	predicts	readmission to dermatologist
readmission	indicates	treatment failure
treatment failure	may require	systemic therapy
systemic therapy	includes	oral antibiotics
oral antibiotics	include	doxycycline
doxycycline	is	tetracycline
tetracycline	inhibits	protein synthesis
protein synthesis	is	essential for bacteria
bacteria	develop	resistance
resistance	reduces	antibiotic efficacy
antibiotic efficacy	influences	mortality risk
mortality risk	is	low for acne
low mortality	but high morbidity	due to	scarring
scarring	leads to	psychological distress
psychological distress	increases	suicide risk
suicide risk	is	public health concern
public health concern	requires	screening
screening	uses	PHQ‑9
PHQ‑9	is	depression questionnaire
depression	co‑exists	anxiety
anxiety	worsens	acne severity
acne severity	is	graded by	Global Acne Grading System
Global Acne Grading System	guides	therapy choice
therapy choice	includes	benzoyl peroxide
benzoyl peroxide	is	oxidizing agent
oxidizing agent	kills	bacteria
bacteria	are	susceptible	to	oxidative stress
oxidative stress	damages	DNA
DNA damage	triggers	apoptosis
apoptosis	removes	infected cells
infected cells	reduce	lesion size
lesion size	decreases	inflammation
inflammation	reduces	erythema
erythema	improves	cosmetic appearance
cosmetic appearance	boosts	self‑esteem
self‑esteem	lowers	depression
depression	lowers	suicide risk
suicide risk	lowers	mortality
mortality	is	influenced by	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	increases	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	readmission
readmission	signals	inadequate outpatient care
outpatient care	improves	adherence
adherence	reduces	relapse
relapse	reduces	scarring
scarring	reduces	cosmetic burden
cosmetic burden	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	measured by	Dermatology Life Quality Index
Dermatology Life Quality Index	predicts	treatment satisfaction
treatment satisfaction	predicts	adherence
adherence	predicts	long‑term remission
long‑term remission	reduces	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	influence	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	affects	prescription access
prescription access	determines	medication choice
medication choice	includes	retinoids
retinoids	are	vitamin A derivatives
vitamin A derivatives	normalize	keratinization
keratinization	prevents	follicular plugging
follicular plugging	reduces	comedone formation
comedone formation	reduces	acne
acne	reduces	inflammatory cytokines
inflammatory cytokines	include	IL‑1β
IL‑1β	promotes	neutrophil recruitment
neutrophil recruitment	causes	tissue damage
tissue damage	leads to	scarring
scarring	can be	keloid
keloid	is	hypertrophic scar
hypertrophic scar	treated with	silicone sheets
silicone sheets	reduce	scar formation
scar formation	lowers	cosmetic dissatisfaction
cosmetic dissatisfaction	increases	anxiety
anxiety	worsens	sleep quality
sleep quality	affects	immune function
immune function	modulates	acne severity
acne severity	predicts	treatment response
treatment response	informs	future therapy selection
