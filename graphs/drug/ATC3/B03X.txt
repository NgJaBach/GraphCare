antianemic preparations	belong to	ATC
ATC	classifies	drugs
antianemic preparations	include	iron salts
iron salts	are	supplements
iron salts	treat	iron deficiency
iron deficiency	causes	anemia
anemia	leads to	fatigue
fatigue	reduces	productivity
antianemic preparations	include	folic acid
folic acid	prevents	neural tube defects
neural tube defects	occur in	pregnancy
pregnancy	requires	prenatal vitamins
prenatal vitamins	contain	folic acid
antianemic preparations	include	vitamin B12
vitamin B12	treats	pernicious anemia
pernicious anemia	causes	neuropathy
neuropathy	impairs	gait
antianemic preparations	include	erythropoietin
erythropoietin	stimulates	erythropoiesis
erythropoiesis	increases	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	improves	oxygen transport
oxygen transport	reduces	hypoxia
hypoxia	causes	organ dysfunction
organ dysfunction	predicts	mortality
antianemic preparations	include	darbepoetin alfa
darbepoetin alfa	is a	synthetic erythropoietin
synthetic erythropoietin	used in	chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease	leads to	anemia
anemia	increases	readmission risk
readmission risk	predicts	hospital stay
hospital stay	costs	healthcare
healthcare costs	influence	insurance premiums
insurance premiums	affect	patient adherence
patient adherence	determines	treatment efficacy
treatment efficacy	measured by	hemoglobin level
hemoglobin level	monitored by	CBC
CBC	detects	anemia
anemia	classified by	MCV
MCV	indicates	iron deficiency
iron deficiency	treated with	iron sucrose
iron sucrose	administered	intravenously
intravenously	bypasses	GI absorption
GI absorption	limited by	gastric pH
gastric pH	altered by	proton pump inhibitors
proton pump inhibitors	reduce	iron absorption
iron absorption	necessary for	hemoglobin synthesis
hemoglobin synthesis	requires	heme
heme	derived from	iron
iron	sourced from	diet
diet	includes	red meat
red meat	high in	heme iron
heme iron	absorbed	efficiently
efficient absorption	reduces	iron deficiency
iron deficiency	leads to	microcytic anemia
microcytic anemia	diagnosed by	low MCV
low MCV	indicates	iron deficiency
iron deficiency	treated with	ferrous sulfate
ferrous sulfate	causes	GI upset
GI upset	reduces	adherence
adherence	predicts	treatment success
treatment success	measured by	reticulocyte count
reticulocyte count	rises after	erythropoietin
erythropoietin	contraindicated in	uncontrolled hypertension
uncontrolled hypertension	monitored by	blood pressure
blood pressure	measured by	cuff
cuff	used in	primary care
primary care	prescribes	antianemic preparations
prescriptions	tracked by	pharmacy records
pharmacy records	used for	medication reconciliation
medication reconciliation	reduces	adverse drug events
adverse drug events	increase	mortality
mortality	predicted by	risk scores
risk scores	include	comorbidity index
comorbidity index	accounts for	anemia severity
anemia severity	correlates with	hospitalization rate
hospitalization rate	influences	quality metrics
quality metrics	affect	hospital reimbursement
hospital reimbursement	drives	resource allocation
resource allocation	determines	availability of iron therapy
availability	impacts	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	measured by	functional status
functional status	assessed by	6‑minute walk test
6‑minute walk test	predicts	mortality
mortality	linked to	anemia type
anemia type	classified by	RBC morphology
RBC morphology	examined in	peripheral smear
peripheral smear	shows	microcytosis
microcytosis	indicates	iron deficiency
iron deficiency	treated with	oral iron
oral iron	less effective than	IV iron
IV iron	used in	severe anemia
severe anemia	requires	transfusion
transfusion	carries	infection risk
infection risk	increases	readmission
readmission	tracked by	hospital data
hospital data	informs	predictive models
predictive models	guide	treatment pathways
treatment pathways	optimize	patient care
patient care	improves	survival
survival	measured by	1‑year mortality
