vitamin K	is a	cofactor
vitamin K	activates	clotting factors
clotting factors	include	factor II
clotting factors	include	factor VII
clotting factors	include	factor IX
clotting factors	include	factor X
clotting factors	are needed for	coagulation
coagulation	prevents	hemorrhage
hemorrhage	leads to	blood loss
blood loss	causes	anemia
anemia	reduces	oxygen delivery
oxygen delivery	is critical for	organ function
organ function	failure leads to	mortality
vitamin K	deficiency causes	bleeding disorders
bleeding disorders	increase	readmission risk
vitamin K	is found in	leafy greens
leafy greens	are high in	folate
folate	is essential for	DNA synthesis
DNA synthesis	is required for	cell proliferation
cell proliferation	occurs in	bone marrow
bone marrow	produces	platelets
platelets	are needed for	clot formation
clot formation	is part of	hemostasis
hemostasis	is disrupted by	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	include	warfarin
warfarin	inhibits	vitamin K cycle
vitamin K cycle	is necessary for	gamma‑carboxylation
gamma‑carboxylation	modifies	clotting factors
clotting factors	are measured by	INR
INR	is monitored in	warfarin therapy
warfarin therapy	requires	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	depends on	liver function
liver function	is impaired by	hepatitis
hepatitis	increases	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	is mitigated by	vitamin K supplementation
vitamin K supplementation	is given as	oral tablets
oral tablets	have	bioavailability
bioavailability	is affected by	fat intake
fat intake	is influenced by	diet
diet	influences	nutrient absorption
nutrient absorption	is reduced by	malabsorption
malabsorption	occurs in	celiac disease
celiac disease	leads to	vitamin K deficiency
vitamin K deficiency	causes	prolonged clotting time
prolonged clotting time	is measured by	PT
PT	is part of	coagulation panel
coagulation panel	is ordered for	bleeding assessment
bleeding assessment	informs	transfusion strategy
transfusion strategy	includes	platelet transfusion
platelet transfusion	is guided by	platelet count
platelet count	is low in	thrombocytopenia
thrombocytopenia	can be caused by	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	increases	infection risk
infection risk	leads to	sepsis
sepsis	requires	ICU admission
ICU admission	increases	mortality
mortality	is predicted by	APACHE score
APACHE score	incorporates	coagulation parameters
coagulation parameters	include	INR
INR	is influenced by	vitamin K intake
vitamin K intake	is monitored by	dietary recall
dietary recall	is collected during	admission
admission	triggers	discharge planning
discharge planning	includes	medication reconciliation
medication reconciliation	checks for	warfarin
warfarin	requires	INR monitoring
INR monitoring	is done by	point‑of‑care testing
point‑of‑care testing	improves	adherence
adherence	reduces	readmission
readmission	is predicted by	comorbidity index
comorbidity index	includes	liver disease
liver disease	affects	vitamin K metabolism
vitamin K metabolism	is impaired by	cholestasis
cholestasis	is treated with	bile acids
bile acids	enhance	vitamin K absorption
vitamin K absorption	is measured by	plasma levels
plasma levels	guide	supplementation dose
supplementation dose	is adjusted for	renal function
renal function	is assessed by	eGFR
eGFR	is reduced in	chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease	increases	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	is mitigated by	vitamin K
vitamin K	is contraindicated in	hypervitaminosis K
hypervitaminosis K	leads to	thrombosis
thrombosis	is treated with	heparin
heparin	is monitored by	aPTT
aPTT	is influenced by	factor VIII
factor VIII	is elevated in	liver disease
liver disease	also causes	vitamin K deficiency
vitamin K deficiency	is corrected by	vitamin K1
vitamin K1	is administered via	IV route
IV route	bypasses	gastrointestinal tract
bypassing GI tract	is useful in	malabsorption
malabsorption	includes	pancreatic insufficiency
pancreatic insufficiency	is treated with	enzyme replacement
enzyme replacement	improves	fat digestion
fat digestion	enhances	vitamin K absorption
vitamin K absorption	reduces	bleeding episodes
bleeding episodes	lower	mortality risk
mortality risk	is a target for	quality improvement
