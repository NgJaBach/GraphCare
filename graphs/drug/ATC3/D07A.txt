glucocorticoid	is a	steroid
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	are	topical
topical	applied to	skin
skin	exhibits	redness
redness	indicates	inflammation
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	have	potency
potency	measured in	potency scale
potency scale	ranges from	low
potency scale	ranges to	high
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	can cause	skin thinning
skin thinning	increases	risk of bruising
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	can cause	striae
striae	are	stretch marks
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	can cause	telangiectasia
telangiectasia	are	dilated capillaries
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	can cause	acneiform eruptions
acneiform eruptions	are	acne-like lesions

corticosteroid dermatological preparations	are	classified by	class
class	indicates	potency
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	are	classified by	vehicle
vehicle	can be	ointment
vehicle	can be	cream
vehicle	can be	lotion
vehicle	can be	gel
vehicle	can be	spray
vehicle	affects	absorption
absorption	influences	efficacy
efficacy	predicts	symptom relief
symptom relief	reduces	patient discomfort
patient discomfort	improves	quality of life
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	are	contraindicated in	pregnancy
pregnancy	increases	risk of fetal exposure
fetal exposure	may cause	growth restriction
growth restriction	leads to	low birth weight
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	are	contraindicated in	infants
infants	have	thin skin
thin skin	increases	absorption
absorption	increases	systemic exposure
systemic exposure	can cause	adrenal suppression
adrenal suppression	leads to	cortisol deficiency
cortisol deficiency	results in	fatigue
fatigue	reduces	daily functioning
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	are	contraindicated in	immunocompromised patients
immunocompromised patients	have	increased infection risk
infection risk	leads to	delayed wound healing
delayed wound healing	increases	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	is	outcome measure
corticosteroid dermatological preparations	are	used in	atopic dermatitis
atopic dermatitis	is	chronic
chronic	requires	long-term therapy
long-term therapy	increases	risk of side effects
side effects	include	skin atrophy
skin atrophy	is	measurable by	skin thickness
skin thickness	measured by	ultrasound
ultrasound	predicts	treatment response
treatment response	informs	dosage adjustment
dosage adjustment	reduces	adverse events
adverse events	improve	patient adherence
patient adherence	predicts	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	relapse
relapse	increases	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	predicts	cost
cost	is	economic burden
economic burden	influences	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	determines	prescription availability
prescription availability	affects	patient access
patient access	impacts	disease progression
disease progression	leads to	disability
disability	is	measured by	disability index
disability index	predicts	mortality
mortality	is	influenced by	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	increases	readmission
readmission	is	predictor of	30‑day mortality
30‑day mortality	is	quality metric
quality metric	drives	hospital reimbursement
hospital reimbursement	influences	resource allocation
resource allocation	affects	treatment availability
treatment availability	determines	clinical outcomes
clinical outcomes	are	captured by	electronic health record
electronic health record	provides	data for	predictive modeling
predictive modeling	identifies	high‑risk patients
high‑risk patients	receive	targeted interventions
targeted interventions	reduce	adverse events
adverse events	lower	mortality
mortality	is	ultimate endpoint
endpoint	informs	guideline updates
guideline updates	refine	corticosteroid dermatological preparations usage
