spontaneous pneumothorax	is a type of	pneumothorax
spontaneous pneumothorax	treated with	observation
spontaneous pneumothorax	treated with	oxygen therapy
pneumothorax	may require	chest tube
pneumothorax	may require	pleurodesis
pleurodesis	reduces	pneumothorax recurrence
recurrence	is possible after	pneumothorax
recurrent pneumothorax	increases need for	pleurodesis
chest tube	drains	pleural air
needle decompression	relieves	tension pneumothorax
tension pneumothorax	is a	medical emergency
