specialist	is part of	surgical team
surgical team	includes	anesthesiologist
anesthesiologist	administers	anesthesia
anesthesia	is monitored by	anesthesia monitor
anesthesia monitor	records	vital signs
vital signs	are used to	assess stability
stability	is assessed by	critical care team
critical care team	includes	intensivist
intensivist	manages	ICU care
ICU care	includes	ventilator support
ventilator support	is adjusted by	respiratory therapist
respiratory therapist	monitors	oxygenation
oxygenation	is measured by	pulse oximetry
pulse oximetry	provides	SpO2
SpO2	guides	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	is prescribed by	pulmonologist
pulmonologist	is a	specialist
specialist	is part of	multidisciplinary team
multidisciplinary team	collaborates on	discharge planning
discharge planning	includes	rehabilitation referral
rehabilitation referral	is to	physical therapy
physical therapy	improves	mobility
mobility	reduces	fall risk
fall risk	is assessed by	fall risk assessment
fall risk assessment	is performed by	occupational therapist
occupational therapist	evaluates	home safety
home safety	is improved by	safety modifications
safety modifications	reduce	injury recurrence
injury recurrence	is a	readmission risk
readmission risk	is predicted by	prior admission history
prior admission history	is recorded in	electronic health record
electronic health record	is accessed by	clinical decision support
clinical decision support	alerts	high-risk patients
high-risk patients	receive	targeted interventions
targeted interventions	include	medication reconciliation
medication reconciliation	is performed by	pharmacist
pharmacist	reviews	drug interactions
drug interactions	are flagged by	drug interaction database
drug interaction database	is updated by	pharmacovigilance
pharmacovigilance	monitors	adverse drug events
adverse drug events	are reported to	regulatory agency
regulatory agency	issues	safety alerts
safety alerts	inform	prescriber behavior
prescriber behavior	influences	medication adherence
medication adherence	affects	disease control
disease control	is measured by	biomarker levels
biomarker levels	are tracked in	laboratory information system
laboratory information system	integrates with	clinical workflow
clinical workflow	is optimized by	process improvement
process improvement	uses	Lean methodology
Lean methodology	reduces	waste
waste	reduces	cost
cost	is monitored by	health economics
health economics	informs	reimbursement policy
reimbursement policy	affects	resource availability
resource availability	influences	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	are evaluated by	quality metrics
quality metrics	are reported to	accreditation bodies
accreditation bodies	set standards for	patient safety
patient safety	is improved by	safety culture
safety culture	is fostered by	leadership engagement
leadership engagement	drives	continuous improvement
continuous improvement	leads to	better care delivery
better care delivery	reduces	adverse events
adverse events	are captured by	incident reporting
incident reporting	feeds into	root cause analysis
root cause analysis	identifies	system failures
system failures	are corrected by	corrective action
corrective action	prevents	future errors
