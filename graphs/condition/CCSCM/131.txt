respiratory failure	is a	life‑threatening condition
respiratory failure	causes	hypoxia
respiratory failure	leads to	organ dysfunction
respiratory failure	is diagnosed by	arterial blood gas
respiratory failure	is treated with	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	is a	life support modality
mechanical ventilation	requires	ICU admission
ICU admission	increases	infection risk
infection risk	raises	mortality rate
mortality rate	is predicted by	APACHE II score
APACHE II score	is calculated from	vital signs
vital signs	include	heart rate
vital signs	include	blood pressure
vital signs	include	respiratory rate
respiratory rate	is measured by	pulse oximetry
pulse oximetry	measures	oxygen saturation
oxygen saturation	is reduced in	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	is treated with	supplemental oxygen
supplemental oxygen	is delivered by	nasal cannula
nasal cannula	is a	low‑flow device
low‑flow device	is used for	mild hypoxia
mild hypoxia	may progress to	severe hypoxia
severe hypoxia	requires	high‑flow nasal cannula
high‑flow nasal cannula	is a	non‑invasive support
non‑invasive support	includes	CPAP
CPAP	is a	continuous positive airway pressure
continuous positive airway pressure	improves	lung compliance
lung compliance	is measured by	spirometry
spirometry	detects	obstructive disease
obstructive disease	includes	COPD
COPD	is a	chronic lung disease
chronic lung disease	predisposes to	respiratory failure
respiratory failure	is classified by	type
type	includes	hypoxemic
type	includes	hypercapnic
hypercapnic	is associated with	COPD
hypoxemic	is associated with	pneumonia
pneumonia	is diagnosed by	chest X‑ray
chest X‑ray	shows	infiltrates
infiltrates	indicate	infection
infection	is treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	are prescribed based on	culture sensitivity
culture sensitivity	guides	antibiotic selection
antibiotic selection	affects	resistance pattern
resistance pattern	influences	treatment success
treatment success	predicts	survival probability
survival probability	is modeled by	logistic regression
logistic regression	uses	comorbidity index
comorbidity index	includes	Charlson score
Charlson score	predicts	1‑year mortality
1‑year mortality	is a	long‑term outcome
long‑term outcome	is influenced by	smoking status
smoking status	is recorded in	patient history
patient history	is reviewed by	discharge planning
discharge planning	reduces	readmission risk
readmission risk	is estimated by	LACE index
LACE index	incorporates	length of stay
length of stay	is extended by	complications
complications	include	ventilator‑associated pneumonia
ventilator‑associated pneumonia	is prevented by	oral care
oral care	reduces	infection rate
infection rate	lowers	ICU mortality
ICU mortality	is correlated with	sedation depth
sedation depth	is monitored by	Richmond Agitation‑Sedation Scale
Richmond Agitation‑Sedation Scale	guides	sedation protocol
sedation protocol	affects	delirium incidence
delirium incidence	predicts	functional outcome
functional outcome	is measured by	Barthel index
Barthel index	informs	rehabilitation plan
rehabilitation plan	improves	quality of life
quality of life	is assessed by	SF‑36
SF‑36	scores	physical component
physical component	is linked to	mobility status
mobility status	is evaluated by	gait speed
gait speed	predicts	fall risk
fall risk	is mitigated by	home safety assessment
home safety assessment	is conducted by	occupational therapist
occupational therapist	provides	assistive devices
assistive devices	reduce	injury risk
injury risk	lowers	emergency department visits
emergency department visits	are tracked by	readmission database
readmission database	feeds into	predictive analytics
predictive analytics	use	machine learning
machine learning	models	patient trajectories
patient trajectories	inform	personalized care
personalized care	enhances	adherence
adherence	is measured by	medication possession ratio
medication possession ratio	predicts	disease control
disease control	is reflected in	biomarker levels
biomarker levels	include	C‑reactive protein
C‑reactive protein	rises in	inflammation
inflammation	is managed by	anti‑inflammatory drugs
anti‑inflammatory drugs	include	corticosteroids
corticosteroids	are prescribed for	acute exacerbation
acute exacerbation	leads to	increased oxygen demand
oxygen demand	is met by	ventilator settings
ventilator settings	are adjusted by	tidal volume
tidal volume	is calculated from	predicted body weight
predicted body weight	is derived from	height
height	is recorded in	anthropometric data
