drowning	is a	mechanism of injury
drowning	is coded as	external-cause code
submersion	is a	mechanism of injury
submersion	leads to	hypoxia
near-drowning	is a	submersion incident
near-drowning	results in	pulmonary edema
hypoxia	causes	brain injury
drowning	causes	asphyxia
asphyxia	leads to	hypoxemia
drowning	leads to	cardiac arrest
cardiac arrest	requires	cardiopulmonary resuscitation
drowning	increases	hospital admission
drowning	increases	emergency department visits
drowning	increases	ICU admission
drowning	leads to	airway compromise
airway compromise	requires	intubation
intubation	is a	airway management procedure
airway management	includes	suctioning
drowning event	occurs in	households
drowning event	occurs in	pools
drowning event	occurs in	oceans
drowning event	occurs in	rivers
pools	site of	drowning events
oceans	site of	drowning events
rivers	site of	drowning events
bathtubs	site of	drowning events
infants	at risk for	drowning
children	at risk for	drowning
adults	at risk for	drowning
alcohol use	associated with	drowning
swimming	involved in	drowning incidents
fatigue	associated with	drowning risk
supervision of children near water	reduces	drowning risk
supervision	reduces	drowning risk
fencing around pool	reduces	drowning risk
children	benefit from	pool safety education
pool safety education	improves	safety awareness
water temperature	influences	near-drowning risk
cold water	increases	drowning risk
strong currents	increase	drowning risk
drowning	sometimes results in	coma
coma	leads to	long-term disability
long-term disability	decreases	quality of life
quality of life	affected by	brain injury
brain injury	affects	cognitive function
cognitive function	influences	rehabilitation outcomes
rehabilitation	improves	physical function
CPR timing	influences	survival
timely CPR	improves	survival
delay in CPR	worsens	outcome
resuscitation	improved by	EMS response time
EMS response time	affects	survival
drowning	leads to	respiratory failure
respiratory failure	requires	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	used in	drowning cases
drowning	associated with	alcohol intoxication
drowning	described by	e-code
external-cause code	used for	drowning
ICD coding	supports	drowning classification
drowning classification	based on	e-codes
e-codes	include	drowning/submersion
drowning/submersion	is a	ICD-9-CM external cause
e-codes	relate to	drowning/submersion
drowning/submersion	documented in	health records
health records	contain	e-codes
e-codes	aid	public health surveillance
drowning incidents	tracked by	vital statistics
vital statistics	inform	prevention programs
prevention programs	reduce	drowning rates
program evaluation	measures	drowning outcomes
drowning outcomes	inform	policy decisions
policy decisions	aim to	reduce drowning
pool barriers	prevent	drowning events
drowning events	monitored by	vital records
vital records	support	drowning surveillance
drowning surveillance	informs	resource allocation
resource allocation	affects	prevention programs
prevention programs	reduce	drowning incidence
drowning incidence	decreased by	public health campaigns
public health campaigns	educate	communities
communities	engage	water safety practices
water safety practices	improve	rescue outcomes
rescue outcomes	depend on	bystander CPR
bystander CPR	increases	survival
survival	associated with	good prognosis
prognosis	improves with	early transport to hospital
transport to hospital	reduces	time to care
time to care	influences	mortality
mortality	highest in	elderly drowning
elderly	at higher risk for	drowning
seasonal variation	affects	drowning rates
seasonal variation	documented in	health data
health data	used for	trend analysis
trend analysis	informs	policy
policy	aims at	drowning prevention
drowning prevention	implemented by	community programs
community programs	reduce	drowning rates
