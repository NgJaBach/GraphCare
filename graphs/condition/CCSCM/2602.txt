drowning	is a	fatal injury
submersion	is a	water exposure
drowning	causes	hypoxia
hypoxia	leads to	brain injury
brain injury	predicts	mortality
drowning	is classified by	ICD‑10
ICD‑10	includes	E950
E950	is a	drowning code
E950	indicates	unintentional drowning
unintentional drowning	is a	public health concern
public health concern	requires	prevention
prevention	includes	life jacket use
life jacket use	reduces	drowning risk
drowning	is associated with	age
age	influences	survival
survival	depends on	resuscitation
resuscitation	includes	CPR
CPR	improves	survival
survival	predicts	long‑term outcome
long‑term outcome	includes	neurological deficit
neuro deficit	predicts	readmission
readmission	is a	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	drives	resource allocation
resource allocation	informs	emergency planning
emergency planning	includes	water safety
water safety	involves	signage
signage	reduces	drowning incidents
drowning incidents	are recorded by	EMS
EMS	logs	response time
response time	predicts	survival
survival	is higher with	early defibrillation
early defibrillation	requires	AED
AED	is located at	public sites
public sites	include	parks
parks	have	swimming pools
swimming pools	are monitored by	lifeguard
lifeguard	reduces	drowning
drowning	is linked to	alcohol use
alcohol use	increases	risk
risk	is mitigated by	education
education	targets	youth
youth	are at	higher risk
higher risk	leads to	targeted programs
targeted programs	include	swim lessons
swim lessons	improve	safety
safety	reduces	drowning
drowning	is reported by	coroners
coroners	provide	mortality data
mortality data	informs	policy
policy	sets	safety standards
safety standards	enforce	fencing
fencing	prevents	unsupervised access
unsupervised access	causes	drowning
drowning	is a	cause of death
cause of death	is recorded in	death certificates
death certificates	used for	epidemiology
epidemiology	identifies	hotspots
hotspots	guide	resource deployment
resource deployment	includes	patrols
patrols	reduce	incidents
incidents	are tracked by	GIS
GIS	maps	risk areas
risk areas	are targeted by	community outreach
community outreach	includes	safety talks
safety talks	raise	awareness
awareness	lowers	drowning
drowning	is a	preventable cause
preventable cause	is a	public health goal
public health goal	drives	funding
funding	supports	training
training	enhances	rescue skills
rescue skills	improve	outcomes
outcomes	measured by	survival rate
survival rate	is a	quality metric
quality metric	informs	hospital performance
hospital performance	affects	reimbursement
reimbursement	influences	staffing
staffing	determines	response capacity
response capacity	affects	survival
survival	is linked to	oxygenation
oxygenation	achieved by	hyperbaric therapy
hyperbaric therapy	used for	drowning victims
victims	may develop	pulmonary edema
pulmonary edema	requires	ICU
ICU	provides	advanced care
advanced care	reduces	mortality
mortality	is a	key indicator
key indicator	used in	risk stratification
risk stratification	guides	triage
triage	prioritizes	critical patients
critical patients	receive	rapid intervention
rapid intervention	improves	prognosis
prognosis	predicts	long‑term survival
long‑term survival	depends on	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	includes	physical therapy
physical therapy	restores	function
function	is measured by	functional status
functional status	predicts	readmission
readmission	is a	quality concern
quality concern	drives	quality improvement
