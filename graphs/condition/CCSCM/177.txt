spontaneous abortion	is a	pregnancy loss
spontaneous abortion	occurs before	20 weeks
spontaneous abortion	is caused by	chromosomal abnormality
chromosomal abnormality	is detected by	karyotype
karyotype	is performed on	chorionic villi
chorionic villi	are sampled by	chorionic villus sampling
chorionic villus sampling	is a	prenatal test
prenatal test	predicts	miscarriage risk
miscarriage risk	is increased by	advanced maternal age
advanced maternal age	is defined as	>35 years
advanced maternal age	is associated with	decreased ovarian reserve
decreased ovarian reserve	leads to	lower embryo quality
lower embryo quality	increases	spontaneous abortion
spontaneous abortion	is associated with	maternal hypertension
maternal hypertension	is treated with	antihypertensives
antihypertensives	include	labetalol
labetalol	is a	beta blocker
beta blocker	reduces	blood pressure
reduced blood pressure	lowers	placental perfusion
placental perfusion	is essential for	fetal growth
fetal growth	is monitored by	ultrasound
ultrasound	detects	fetal anomalies
fetal anomalies	increase	spontaneous abortion
spontaneous abortion	is linked to	smoking
smoking	is a	teratogen
teratogen	causes	DNA damage
DNA damage	leads to	embryonic arrest
embryonic arrest	results in	miscarriage
miscarriage	is reported by	patient history
patient history	is recorded in	electronic health record
electronic health record	stores	medication list
medication list	includes	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	are prescribed for	thrombophilia
thrombophilia	increases	placental thrombosis
placental thrombosis	causes	fetal hypoxia
fetal hypoxia	leads to	spontaneous abortion
spontaneous abortion	is predicted by	machine learning model
machine learning model	uses	clinical variables
clinical variables	include	BMI
BMI	is calculated from	weight and height
weight	is measured by	scale
height	is measured by	stadiometer
BMI	is categorized as	overweight
overweight	is associated with	insulin resistance
insulin resistance	leads to	gestational diabetes
gestational diabetes	increases	miscarriage risk
miscarriage risk	is mitigated by	glucose control
glucose control	is achieved with	metformin
metformin	is a	biguanide
biguanide	reduces	insulin resistance
insulin resistance	decreases	spontaneous abortion
spontaneous abortion	is managed with	counseling
counseling	is provided by	psychologist
psychologist	offers	stress reduction
stress reduction	lowers	cortisol levels
cortisol levels	influence	immune function
immune function	affects	implantation success
implantation success	determines	pregnancy viability
pregnancy viability	is monitored by	progesterone level
progesterone level	is measured by	blood test
blood test	detects	luteal phase defect
luteal phase defect	is treated with	progesterone supplementation
progesterone supplementation	is a	hormone therapy
hormone therapy	reduces	miscarriage rate
miscarriage rate	is tracked by	registry
registry	collects	demographic data
demographic data	includes	ethnicity
ethnicity	correlates with	genetic predisposition
genetic predisposition	is identified by	whole genome sequencing
whole genome sequencing	reveals	risk alleles
risk alleles	predict	spontaneous abortion
spontaneous abortion	is associated with	anemia
anemia	is diagnosed by	hemoglobin test
hemoglobin test	shows	low hemoglobin
low hemoglobin	leads to	uterine hypoxia
uterine hypoxia	causes	miscarriage
miscarriage	is prevented by	iron supplementation
iron supplementation	is a	micronutrient
micronutrient	improves	red blood cell count
red blood cell count	supports	oxygen delivery
oxygen delivery	is critical for	embryonic development
embryonic development	is monitored by	fetal heart rate
fetal heart rate	is recorded by	Doppler
Doppler	detects	fetal distress
fetal distress	indicates	potential miscarriage
potential miscarriage	is predicted by	risk score
risk score	is calculated from	clinical data
clinical data	includes	prior miscarriage history
prior miscarriage history	increases	future risk
future risk	is mitigated by	lifestyle changes
lifestyle changes	include	exercise
exercise	improves	cardiovascular health
cardiovascular health	supports	placental blood flow
placental blood flow	reduces	spontaneous abortion
spontaneous abortion	is recorded in	obstetric chart
obstetric chart	is part of	patient record
patient record	is used for	quality improvement
quality improvement	targets	reducing miscarriage rates
reducing miscarriage rates	improves	maternal outcomes
maternal outcomes	are measured by	survival statistics
