allergic reactions	are caused by	IgE antibodies
IgE antibodies	bind to	mast cells
mast cells	release	histamine
histamine	causes	vasodilation
vasodilation	leads to	edema
edema	manifests as	swelling
allergic reactions	present with	hives
hives	are a type of	urticaria
urticaria	is treated with	antihistamines
antihistamines	block	H1 receptors
H1 receptors	are found on	endothelial cells
endothelial cells	regulate	vascular permeability
vascular permeability	increases during	anaphylaxis
anaphylaxis	is a severe form of	allergic reaction
anaphylaxis	requires	epinephrine
epinephrine	is administered via	intramuscular injection
intramuscular injection	is given in	thigh muscle
thigh muscle	is a site for	epinephrine
epinephrine	activates	β2 receptors
β2 receptors	cause	bronchodilation
bronchodilation	improves	airway patency
airway patency	is critical in	asthma
asthma	can be triggered by	allergens
allergens	include	pollen
pollen	is a type of	aeroallergen
aeroallergen	triggers	allergic rhinitis
allergic rhinitis	causes	nasal congestion
nasal congestion	is relieved by	decongestants
decongestants	block	α1 receptors
α1 receptors	are located on	smooth muscle
smooth muscle	contracts during	bronchoconstriction
bronchoconstriction	is a feature of	asthma
asthma	is diagnosed by	spirometry
spirometry	measures	FEV1
FEV1	is reduced in	obstructive lung disease
obstructive lung disease	includes	COPD
COPD	is exacerbated by	smoking
smoking	increases	oxidative stress
oxidative stress	damages	epithelial cells
epithelial cells	produce	cytokines
cytokines	recruit	eosinophils
eosinophils	release	major basic protein
major basic protein	causes	tissue damage
tissue damage	leads to	inflammation
inflammation	is mediated by	prostaglandins
prostaglandins	are synthesized by	COX enzymes
COX enzymes	are inhibited by	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	reduce	pain
pain	is a symptom of	allergic dermatitis
allergic dermatitis	is treated with	topical steroids
topical steroids	suppress	immune response
immune response	involves	T cells
T cells	differentiate into	Th2 cells
Th2 cells	secrete	IL-4
IL-4	promotes	IgE class switching
IgE class switching	occurs in	B cells
B cells	mature in	bone marrow
bone marrow	produces	hematopoietic stem cells
hematopoietic stem cells	differentiate into	myeloid lineage
myeloid lineage	includes	mast cells
mast cells	are activated by	crosslinking
crosslinking	occurs when	IgE binds antigen
antigen	can be	food protein
food protein	triggers	food allergy
food allergy	presents with	gastrointestinal symptoms
gastrointestinal symptoms	include	vomiting
vomiting	is managed by	antiemetics
antiemetics	block	serotonin receptors
serotonin receptors	are present on	gut neurons
gut neurons	regulate	motility
motility	is altered in	irritable bowel syndrome
irritable bowel syndrome	shares symptoms with	allergic colitis
allergic colitis	is diagnosed by	colonoscopy
colonoscopy	visualizes	mucosal inflammation
mucosal inflammation	is treated with	immunosuppressants
immunosuppressants	include	cyclosporine
cyclosporine	inhibits	calcineurin
calcineurin	activates	NFAT
NFAT	drives	T cell activation
T cell activation	is reduced by	corticosteroids
corticosteroids	are metabolized by	CYP3A4
CYP3A4	is induced by	rifampin
rifampin	is used to treat	tuberculosis
tuberculosis	is a risk factor for	immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome	can precipitate	allergic reactions
allergic reactions	increase risk of	cardiovascular events
cardiovascular events	include	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	is predicted by	troponin levels
troponin levels	rise after	myocardial injury
myocardial injury	can be caused by	anaphylaxis
anaphylaxis	is monitored by	pulse oximetry
pulse oximetry	measures	oxygen saturation
oxygen saturation	drops during	severe allergic reaction
severe allergic reaction	may lead to	shock
shock	requires	fluid resuscitation
fluid resuscitation	uses	crystalloids
crystalloids	are administered via	intravenous line
intravenous line	is placed in	forearm vein
forearm vein	is a site for	central venous access
central venous access	is used for	high‑risk patients
