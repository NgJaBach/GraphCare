chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	is a	respiratory disorder
bronchiectasis	is a	airway disease
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	causes	airflow limitation
bronchiectasis	causes	mucus accumulation
airflow limitation	leads to	dyspnea
mucus accumulation	leads to	infection
infection	triggers	exacerbation
exacerbation	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	predicts	readmission
readmission	indicates	disease severity
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	is treated with	bronchodilators
bronchodilators	reduce	airway resistance
bronchodilators	improve	exercise tolerance
bronchodilators	are prescribed with	inhaled corticosteroids
inhaled corticosteroids	reduce	inflammation
inhaled corticosteroids	lower	exacerbation frequency
bronchiectasis	is treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	target	bacterial pathogens
bacterial pathogens	include	Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Pseudomonas aeruginosa	causes	chronic colonization
chronic colonization	worsens	lung function
lung function	measured by	FEV1
FEV1	predicts	survival
survival	inversely correlates with	GOLD stage
GOLD stage	classifies	COPD severity
COPD severity	guides	treatment intensity
treatment intensity	determines	hospitalization risk
hospitalization risk	predicts	30‑day readmission
30‑day readmission	is a	quality metric
quality metric	influences	reimbursement
reimbursement	affects	resource allocation
resource allocation	impacts	patient access
patient access	determines	adherence
adherence	reduces	exacerbation
exacerbation	requires	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	improves	survival
survival	is enhanced by	pulmonary rehabilitation
pulmonary rehabilitation	improves	quality of life
quality of life	is measured by	SGRQ
SGRQ	predicts	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	smoking cessation
smoking cessation	is promoted by	counseling
counseling	increases	quit rates
quit rates	lower	disease progression
disease progression	slows	decline in FEV1
decline in FEV1	is monitored by	spirometry
spirometry	detects	early decline
early decline	allows	early intervention
early intervention	reduces	hospital admissions
hospital admissions	lower	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	influence	insurance premiums
insurance premiums	affect	affordability
affordability	determines	medication adherence
medication adherence	predicts	exacerbation risk
exacerbation risk	is calculated by	BODE index
BODE index	includes	BMI
BMI	correlates with	nutritional status
nutritional status	affects	immune function
immune function	modulates	infection susceptibility
infection susceptibility	determines	antibiotic choice
antibiotic choice	guided by	culture sensitivity
culture sensitivity	informs	treatment duration
treatment duration	impacts	resistance development
resistance development	increases	treatment failure
treatment failure	leads to	readmission
readmission	is a	predictor of mortality
mortality	is reduced by	vaccinations
vaccinations	include	influenza vaccine
influenza vaccine	prevents	viral infection
viral infection	triggers	COPD exacerbation
COPD exacerbation	requires	systemic steroids
systemic steroids	cause	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	is a	risk factor for infection
infection	increases	readmission
readmission	is associated with	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	cardiovascular disease
cardiovascular disease	raises	mortality risk
mortality risk	is mitigated by	statins
statins	lower	cardiovascular events
cardiovascular events	reduce	overall mortality
overall mortality	is influenced by	age
age	is a	predictor of disease progression
disease progression	is tracked by	imaging
imaging	detects	bronchial dilation
bronchial dilation	confirms	bronchiectasis
bronchiectasis	is graded by	Bhalla score
Bhalla score	predicts	prognosis
prognosis	informs	palliative care decisions
palliative care	improves	symptom control
symptom control	enhances	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	correlates with	adherence
adherence	reduces	exacerbation
exacerbation	lowers	lung function
lung function	measured by	DLCO
DLCO	predicts	exercise capacity
exercise capacity	is a	marker of frailty
frailty	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	is a	cost driver
cost driver	influences	policy decisions
policy decisions	shape	clinical guidelines
