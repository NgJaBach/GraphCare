peritonitis	is a	medical emergency
peritonitis	associated with	sepsis
peritonitis	leads to	septic shock
peritonitis	increases risk of	mortality
peritonitis	increases risk of	readmission
peritonitis	treated with	antibiotics
peritonitis	treated with	surgery
peritonitis	treated with	drainage
peritonitis	requires	hospitalization
peritonitis	diagnosed by	paracentesis
paracentesis	yields	neutrophils
paracentesis	indicates	infection
peritoneal fluid	contains	bacteria
abscess	is a	localized collection of pus
intestinal abscess	is a	localized collection of pus
abscess	may complicate	peritonitis
peritonitis	can cause	ileus
ileus	presents with	abdominal distension
ileus	may require	nasogastric decompression
peritonitis	associated with	fever
peritonitis	associated with	leukocytosis
peritonitis	associated with	elevated CRP
peritonitis	diagnosed by	CT scan
peritonitis	diagnosed by	ultrasound
peritonitis	diagnosed by	diagnostic laparoscopy
CT scan	is a	imaging modality
ultrasound	is a	imaging modality
abscess	treated with	antibiotics
abscess	treated with	drainage
abscess	requires	hospitalization
intestinal abscess	treated with	drainage
intestinal abscess	treated with	antibiotics
intestinal abscess	requires	drainage
peritonitis	predisposes to	sepsis
peritonitis	increases	hospital stay
peritonitis	increases	resource use
intestinal abscess	is a	localized infection
intestinal abscess	diagnosed by	CT scan
intestinal abscess	diagnosed by	ultrasound
intestinal abscess	can cause	peritonitis
peritonitis	can lead to	abscess formation
abscess	located in	peritoneal cavity
peritoneal cavity	contains	pus
peritoneal infection	increases risk of	sepsis
peritoneal infection	diagnosed by	ascitic fluid culture
ascitic fluid culture	yields	bacteria
bacteria	cause	peritonitis
E. coli	commonly causes	peritonitis
Streptococcus	commonly causes	peritonitis
Bacteroides	commonly causes	peritonitis
peritonitis	treated with	broad-spectrum antibiotics
carbapenems	used for	peritonitis
piperacillin-tazobactam	used for	peritonitis
meropenem	used for	peritonitis
vancomycin	used for	peritonitis
antibiotics	are used for	peritonitis
peritoneal dialysis	associated with	peritonitis
cirrhosis	associated with	peritonitis
kidney failure	associated with	peritonitis
diabetes mellitus	associated with	peritonitis
malnutrition	associated with	peritonitis
peritonitis	has	high mortality
perforated viscus	causes	peritonitis
appendix rupture	causes	peritonitis
peritonitis	common in	postoperative patients
paracentesis	used for	therapeutic fluid removal
laparotomy	used for	source control in peritonitis
peritoneal lavage	performed during	surgery
surgery	performed for	source control
peritoneal fluid	analysis shows	neutrophilia
neutrophilia	indicates	bacterial infection
SIRS	associated with	peritonitis
shock	is a	severe complication of peritonitis
mortality	associated with	peritonitis
readmission	associated with	peritonitis
length of stay	increased by	peritonitis
surgical drain	used for	abscess
imaging-guided drainage	preferred for	abscess
peritoneal lavage	part of	source control
source control	critical for	peritonitis outcome
antibiotics	initial therapy for	peritonitis
culture results	guide	antibiotic therapy
culture results	influence	antibiotic choice
antibiotic therapy	aims at	bacterial eradication
bacterial eradication	shortens	hospital stay
treatment failure	associated with	mortality
delayed presentation	associated with	advanced disease
advanced disease	increases	mortality
postoperative peritonitis	occurs after	surgery
postoperative peritonitis	associated with	higher mortality
prognosis	depends on	timely treatment
timely treatment	reduces	mortality
treatment delay	increases	mortality
abscess	has	recurrence
peritonitis	associated with	organ failure
organ failure	increases	mortality
abscess	can be	intra-abdominal source of infection
intra-abdominal source of infection	leads to	peritonitis
peritonitis	requires	surgical source control
intestinal abscess	risk of rupture	high
