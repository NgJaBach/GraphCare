diabetes mellitus	is a	metabolic disorder
diabetes mellitus	causes	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	leads to	glycation
glycation	damages	blood vessels
blood vessels	cause	ischemia
ischemia	results in	organ dysfunction
organ dysfunction	includes	nephropathy
nephropathy	is a	kidney disease
kidney disease	increases	mortality risk
diabetes mellitus	predisposes to	neuropathy
neuropathy	causes	foot ulcer
foot ulcer	requires	wound care
wound care	may need	debridement
debridement	performed by	surgeon
surgeon	may prescribe	antibiotics
antibiotics	treat	infection
infection	increases	readmission risk
readmission risk	is a	quality metric
diabetes mellitus	associated with	retinopathy
retinopathy	leads to	vision loss
vision loss	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	influences	medication adherence
medication adherence	affects	glycemic control
glycemic control	measured by	HbA1c
HbA1c	predicts	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	is mitigated by	statins
statins	are a	lipid-lowering drug
lipid-lowering drug	reduces	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	causes	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	treated with	beta‑blocker
beta‑blocker	is a	cardiovascular drug
cardiovascular drug	lowers	heart rate
heart rate	influences	arrhythmia risk
arrhythmia risk	managed by	antiarrhythmic
antiarrhythmic	is a	drug class
drug class	has	side effect
side effect	may be	nausea
nausea	reduces	drug adherence
drug adherence	predicts	hospitalization
hospitalization	is a	cost driver
cost driver	influences	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	determines	medication access
medication access	affects	disease progression
disease progression	leads to	end‑stage renal disease
end‑stage renal disease	requires	dialysis
dialysis	performed by	nephrologist
nephrologist	may refer	transplant center
transplant center	offers	kidney transplant
kidney transplant	improves	survival
survival	measured by	5‑year mortality
5‑year mortality	is a	prognostic indicator
prognostic indicator	used in	risk stratification
risk stratification	guides	treatment intensity
treatment intensity	includes	insulin therapy
insulin therapy	is a	hormone
hormone	administered by	injection
injection	may cause	hypoglycemia
hypoglycemia	treated with	glucagon
glucagon	is a	rescue medication
rescue medication	stored in	emergency kit
emergency kit	carried by	patient
patient	may experience	hypoglycemia unawareness
hypoglycemia unawareness	increases	severe hypoglycemia risk
severe hypoglycemia risk	predicts	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	continuous glucose monitoring
continuous glucose monitoring	provides	glucose trend
glucose trend	informs	insulin adjustment
insulin adjustment	performed by	endocrinologist
endocrinologist	uses	clinical guidelines
clinical guidelines	recommend	lifestyle modification
lifestyle modification	includes	diet
diet	is prescribed by	dietitian
dietitian	advises	carbohydrate counting
carbohydrate counting	improves	post‑prandial glucose
post‑prandial glucose	reduces	HbA1c
HbA1c	correlates with	microvascular complications
microvascular complications	include	nephropathy
nephropathy	leads to	proteinuria
proteinuria	indicates	kidney damage
kidney damage	monitored by	eGFR
eGFR	predicts	dialysis need
dialysis need	triggers	referral
referral	to	vascular surgeon
vascular surgeon	performs	angioplasty
angioplasty	uses	stent
stent	is a	medical device
medical device	requires	antiplatelet therapy
antiplatelet therapy	is a	drug
drug	reduces	thrombosis
thrombosis	causes	embolism
embolism	leads to	stroke
stroke	results in	disability
disability	affects	functional status
functional status	predicts	readmission
readmission	is a	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	informs	cost‑effectiveness
cost‑effectiveness	guides	policy
policy	sets	reimbursement
reimbursement	influences	drug pricing
drug pricing	determines	patient affordability
