gout	is a	crystal arthropathy
gout	is caused by	hyperuricemia
hyperuricemia	results from	purine metabolism
purine metabolism	is regulated by	xanthine oxidase
xanthine oxidase	is inhibited by	allopurinol
allopurinol	is a	urate-lowering drug
urate-lowering drug	reduces	serum urate
serum urate	is measured by	urinalysis
urinalysis	detects	uric acid crystals
uric acid crystals	deposit in	joint cartilage
joint cartilage	is damaged by	inflammation
inflammation	is mediated by	IL‑1β
IL‑1β	is inhibited by	anakinra
anakinra	is a	IL‑1 receptor antagonist
IL‑1 receptor antagonist	reduces	flare frequency
flare frequency	predicts	readmission risk
readmission risk	is used in	mortality prediction
mortality prediction	incorporates	comorbidity index
comorbidity index	includes	renal dysfunction
renal dysfunction	is worsened by	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	are used for	acute gout pain
acute gout pain	is treated with	colchicine
colchicine	is a	microtubule inhibitor
microtubule inhibitor	reduces	neutrophil migration
neutrophil migration	is part of	inflammatory cascade
inflammatory cascade	is triggered by	crystal deposition
crystal deposition	is visualized by	joint ultrasound
joint ultrasound	detects	tophi
tophi	are composed of	monosodium urate
monosodium urate	is a	crystal type
crystal type	determines	disease severity
disease severity	influences	quality of life
quality of life	is measured by	SF‑36
SF‑36	predicts	hospitalization risk
hospitalization risk	is used in	cost‑effectiveness analysis
cost‑effectiveness analysis	evaluates	allopurinol vs febuxostat
febuxostat	is a	xanthine oxidase inhibitor
xanthine oxidase inhibitor	lowers	uric acid
uric acid	is excreted by	kidneys
kidneys	filter	uric acid
uric acid	is reabsorbed by	URAT1 transporter
URAT1 transporter	is inhibited by	lesinurad
lesinurad	is a	uricosuric agent
uricosuric agent	increases	uric acid excretion
uric acid excretion	reduces	serum urate
serum urate	is a predictor of	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	is assessed by	Framingham score
Framingham score	incorporates	blood pressure
blood pressure	is managed by	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	lower	mortality
mortality	is a key outcome in	clinical trials
clinical trials	report	adverse events
adverse events	include	gastrointestinal bleeding
gastrointestinal bleeding	is prevented by	proton pump inhibitors
proton pump inhibitors	are prescribed with	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	increase	risk of renal failure
renal failure	is monitored by	creatinine clearance
creatinine clearance	predicts	drug dosing
drug dosing	is adjusted by	pharmacokinetics
pharmacokinetics	depends on	hepatic metabolism
hepatic metabolism	involves	CYP2C9
CYP2C9	metabolizes	allopurinol
allopurinol	produces	oxypurinol
oxypurinol	is active	urate-lowering agent
uric acid	forms	needle‑shaped crystals
needle‑shaped crystals	trigger	neutrophil activation
neutrophil activation	releases	reactive oxygen species
reactive oxygen species	cause	oxidative stress
oxidative stress	contributes to	joint damage
joint damage	leads to	chronic pain
chronic pain	is managed by	duloxetine
duloxetine	is a	SNRI
SNRI	reduces	pain perception
pain perception	is measured by	VAS score
VAS score	predicts	disability
disability	is evaluated by	WOMAC index
WOMAC index	informs	physiotherapy plan
physiotherapy plan	includes	exercise therapy
exercise therapy	improves	mobility
mobility	is assessed by	6‑minute walk test
6‑minute walk test	predicts	fall risk
fall risk	is a factor in	hospitalization
hospitalization	is recorded in	electronic health record
electronic health record	stores	medication list
medication list	shows	drug interactions
drug interactions	can cause	hyperuricemia
hyperuricemia	triggers	gout flare
gout flare	requires	emergency care
emergency care	is billed by	ICD‑10 code M10
ICD‑10 code M10	is used for	reimbursement
reimbursement	affects	patient adherence
patient adherence	influences	disease control
disease control	is measured by	serum urate trend
serum urate trend	predicts	flare recurrence
flare recurrence	is a target for	preventive therapy
preventive therapy	includes	lifestyle modification
lifestyle modification	reduces	alcohol intake
alcohol intake	increases	uric acid production
uric acid production	is decreased by	low‑purine diet
low‑purine diet	improves	metabolic profile
