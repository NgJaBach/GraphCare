aortic embolism	is a type of	arterial occlusion
peripheral arterial embolism	is a type of	arterial occlusion
arterial embolism	may cause	limb ischemia
arterial thrombosis	may cause	limb ischemia
limb ischemia	leads to	tissue necrosis
tissue necrosis	requires	amputation
arterial embolism	is diagnosed with	duplex ultrasound
arterial thrombosis	is diagnosed with	CT angiography
duplex ultrasound	detects	blood flow velocity
CT angiography	visualizes	vessel lumen
arterial embolism	is treated with	anticoagulation
arterial thrombosis	is treated with	anticoagulation
anticoagulation	includes	heparin
anticoagulation	includes	warfarin
anticoagulation	includes	DOACs
heparin	is a	parenteral anticoagulant
warfarin	is a	vitamin K antagonist
DOACs	are a	oral anticoagulant
anticoagulation	reduces	re‑occlusion risk
re‑occlusion	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	is higher in	elderly patients
elderly patients	have	comorbid hypertension
hypertension	is a risk factor for	aortic embolism
diabetes mellitus	is a risk factor for	arterial thrombosis
smoking	is a risk factor for	arterial embolism
hyperlipidemia	is a risk factor for	arterial thrombosis
atrial fibrillation	is a source of	emboli
atrial fibrillation	is treated with	anticoagulation
atrial fibrillation	is associated with	left atrial thrombus
left atrial thrombus	can embolize to	aorta
aortic embolism	can originate from	aortic aneurysm
aortic aneurysm	is treated with	surgical repair
surgical repair	reduces	embolic events
arterial embolism	can be managed with	embolectomy
embolectomy	is performed via	surgical approach
embolectomy	improves	limb salvage
limb salvage	reduces	amputation rate
amputation	increases	morbidity
morbidity	is associated with	depression
depression	is treated with	SSRIs
SSRIs	are a type of	antidepressant
antidepressant	can interact with	anticoagulants
drug interaction	increases	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	is monitored by	INR
INR	is monitored in	warfarin therapy
INR	is monitored in	DOAC therapy
DOAC therapy	requires	renal function assessment
renal function	is measured by	eGFR
eGFR	is reduced in	chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease	is a risk factor for	arterial thrombosis
arterial thrombosis	can lead to	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	is treated with	PCI
PCI	involves	stent placement
stent placement	requires	dual antiplatelet therapy
dual antiplatelet therapy	includes	aspirin
dual antiplatelet therapy	includes	clopidogrel
aspirin	is an	antiplatelet
clopidogrel	is an	antiplatelet
antiplatelet	reduces	arterial thrombosis risk
arterial thrombosis	is associated with	peripheral artery disease
peripheral artery disease	is diagnosed with	ankle‑brachial index
ankle‑brachial index	measures	blood flow
blood flow	is impaired in	arterial occlusion
arterial occlusion	leads to	claudication
claudication	is treated with	supervised exercise
supervised exercise	improves	walking distance
walking distance	is a predictor of	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	early intervention
early intervention	includes	anticoagulation
anticoagulation	is contraindicated in	active bleeding
active bleeding	is monitored by	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	is measured in	complete blood count
complete blood count	is part of	routine labs
routine labs	are reviewed in	discharge planning
discharge planning	includes	follow‑up appointments
follow‑up appointments	reduce	readmission
readmission	is a marker of	poor outcome
poor outcome	is predicted by	risk scores
risk scores	include	CHA₂DS₂‑VASc
CHA₂DS₂‑VASc	predicts	embolic risk
embolic risk	is mitigated by	anticoagulation
anticoagulation	is guided by	HAS‑BLED
HAS‑BLED	predicts	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	is managed with	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	is based on	renal function
renal function	is monitored by	serum creatinine
serum creatinine	is part of	metabolic panel
metabolic panel	is ordered in	hospital admission
hospital admission	triggers	multidisciplinary team
multidisciplinary team	includes	cardiology
cardiology	collaborates with	vascular surgery
vascular surgery	performs	bypass grafting
bypass grafting	improves	blood flow
blood flow	reduces	ischemic events
ischemic events	reduce	mortality
mortality	is decreased by	early diagnosis
early diagnosis	relies on	clinical suspicion
clinical suspicion	is enhanced by	education
education	is delivered through	patient counseling
patient counseling	improves	adherence
