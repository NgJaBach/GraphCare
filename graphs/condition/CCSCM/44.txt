histopathology	determines	tumor grade
tumor grade	predicts	prognosis
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	may be	malignant
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	may be	benign
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	may be	borderline
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	are evaluated with	imaging
imaging	includes	CT scan
imaging	includes	MRI
imaging	includes	PET scan
PET scan	detects	metabolic activity
metabolic activity	indicates	malignancy risk
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	are staged with	TNM system
TNM system	assesses	tumor size
TNM system	assesses	nodal involvement
TNM system	assesses	metastasis
tumor size	correlates with	survival rate
nodal involvement	correlates with	recurrence risk
metastasis	correlates with	mortality
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	may require	biopsy
biopsy	can be	core needle
biopsy	can be	excisional
core needle	is less invasive than	excisional
excisional	provides	larger tissue sample
tissue sample	is analyzed for	immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemistry	identifies	tumor markers
tumor markers	guide	targeted therapy
targeted therapy	includes	kinase inhibitors
kinase inhibitors	are used for	specific mutations
specific mutations	detected by	next‑generation sequencing
next‑generation sequencing	informs	personalized medicine
personalized medicine	improves	treatment efficacy
treatment efficacy	reduces	readmission rate
readmission rate	is a predictor of	healthcare cost
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	may be	hormone‑responsive
hormone‑responsive	treated with	endocrine therapy
endocrine therapy	includes	tamoxifen
tamoxifen	is a	selective estrogen receptor modulator
selective estrogen receptor modulator	reduces	recurrence risk
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	may be	immune‑related
immune‑related	treated with	immunotherapy
immunotherapy	includes	checkpoint inhibitors
checkpoint inhibitors	target	PD‑1/PD‑L1
PD‑1/PD‑L1	expression	predicts	response
response	predicts	overall survival
overall survival	is a key outcome
neoplasms of unspecified nature or uncertain behavior	may be	cystic
cystic	requires	cyst aspiration
cyst aspiration	yields	fluid analysis
fluid analysis	checks for	malignant cells
malignant cells	confirm	malignancy
malignancy	necessitates	surgical resection
surgical resection	aims for	negative margins
negative margins	reduce	local recurrence
local recurrence	increases	surveillance frequency
surveillance frequency	guided by	risk stratification
risk stratification	uses	clinical factors
clinical factors	include	age
clinical factors	include	comorbidities
comorbidities	affect	treatment tolerance
treatment tolerance	influences	dosage adjustment
dosage adjustment	impacts	toxicity
toxicity	predicts	quality of life
quality of life	is measured by	patient‑reported outcomes
patient‑reported outcomes	inform	palliative care
palliative care	improves	symptom control
symptom control	reduces	emergency visits
emergency visits	affect	readmission risk
readmission risk	is a factor in	hospital accreditation
hospital accreditation	influences	reimbursement
reimbursement	determines	resource allocation
resource allocation	affects	access to care
access to care	determines	early detection
early detection	lowers	stage at diagnosis
stage at diagnosis	correlates with	survival
survival	is a benchmark for	clinical trials
clinical trials	test	novel agents
novel agents	undergo	phase I/II/III
phase I	assesses	safety
phase II	assesses	efficacy
phase III	compares	standard of care
standard of care	evolves with	evidence
evidence	is synthesized by	meta‑analysis
meta‑analysis	informs	guidelines
guidelines	recommend	surveillance intervals
surveillance intervals	are tailored to	risk profile
risk profile	includes	genetic predisposition
genetic predisposition	identified by	germline testing
germline testing	informs	family counseling
family counseling	reduces	anxiety
anxiety	is associated with	adherence
adherence	predicts	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	mortality
mortality	is a primary endpoint
primary endpoint	drives	drug approval
drug approval	requires	regulatory review
regulatory review	considers	benefit‑risk ratio
benefit‑risk ratio	is calculated from	clinical data
clinical data	is collected by	electronic health records
