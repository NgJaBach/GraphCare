open wounds	are	injuries
open wounds	occur on	head
open wounds	occur on	neck
open wounds	occur on	trunk
head wounds	increase risk of	intracranial hemorrhage
neck wounds	increase risk of	airway obstruction
trunk wounds	increase risk of	hemorrhagic shock
open wounds	require	debridement
debridement	reduces	infection risk
open wounds	need	hemostasis
hemostasis	achieved by	suturing
hemostasis	achieved by	cautery
open wounds	are treated with	topical antibiotics
topical antibiotics	prevent	bacterial colonization
open wounds	are covered by	sterile dressing
sterile dressing	prevents	contamination
open wounds	may develop	necrotizing fasciitis
necrotizing fasciitis	requires	aggressive surgery
open wounds	are assessed by	wound score
wound score	predicts	healing time
open wounds	are monitored for	exudate
exudate	indicates	infection
open wounds	may need	tetanus prophylaxis
tetanus prophylaxis	prevents	tetanus
open wounds	may need	rabies prophylaxis
rabies prophylaxis	prevents	rabies
open wounds	are associated with	pain
pain	managed by	analgesics
analgesics	include	NSAIDs
analgesics	include	opioids
open wounds	can lead to	scarring
scarring	reduces	mobility
scarring	reduces	cosmetic appearance
open wounds	may cause	psychological distress
psychological distress	treated with	counseling
open wounds	increase risk of	sepsis
sepsis	requires	ICU admission
ICU admission	predicts	mortality
mortality	increases with	age
mortality	increases with	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	delays	wound healing
diabetes	increases	infection risk
open wounds	are classified by	depth
depth	predicts	treatment plan
treatment plan	includes	grafting
grafting	improves	closure rate
closure rate	inversely related to	infection
infection	reduces	graft success
open wounds	may be caused by	trauma
trauma	includes	blunt injury
trauma	includes	penetrating injury
penetrating injury	requires	imaging
imaging	includes	CT scan
CT scan	identifies	bone fracture
bone fracture	requires	orthopedic fixation
orthopedic fixation	reduces	morbidity
morbidity	predicts	readmission
readmission	increases	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	is mitigated by	early mobilization
early mobilization	improves	functional outcome
functional outcome	measured by	mobility score
mobility score	predicts	discharge destination
discharge destination	is	home
home	requires	home care
home care	includes	wound dressing
wound dressing	requires	training
training	reduces	complications
complications	include	dehiscence
dehiscence	leads to	prolonged hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	cost
cost	is influenced by	insurance status
insurance status	affects	treatment access
treatment access	influences	outcome
outcome	is	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	early antibiotics
early antibiotics	reduce	bacterial load
bacterial load	reduces	sepsis
sepsis	reduces	survival
survival	is higher with	prompt care
prompt care	requires	triage
triage	uses	ABCDE protocol
ABCDE protocol	prioritizes	airway
airway	secured by	intubation
intubation	reduces	hypoxia
hypoxia	increases	organ failure
organ failure	predicts	mortality
mortality	is higher in	elderly
elderly	have	frailty
frailty	predicts	poor healing
poor healing	leads to	chronic wound
chronic wound	requires	long-term therapy
long-term therapy	includes	negative pressure wound therapy
negative pressure wound therapy	accelerates	granulation
granulation	promotes	closure
closure	reduces	recurrence
recurrence	increases	readmission
readmission	is a marker for	quality of care
quality of care	is measured by	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	influences	adherence
