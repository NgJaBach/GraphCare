gastroduodenal ulcer	presents with	dyspepsia
gastroduodenal ulcer	presents with	nausea
gastroduodenal ulcer	presents with	vomiting
gastroduodenal ulcer	presents with	weight loss
epigastric pain	prompts	endoscopy
endoscopy	detects	gastroduodenal ulcer
endoscopy	guides	biopsy to rule out cancer
biopsy	excludes	gastric cancer
urea breath test	detects	Helicobacter pylori
stool antigen test	detects	Helicobacter pylori
rapid urease test	detects	Helicobacter pylori
gastric biopsy	shows	chronic gastritis
ulcer	risk factor	NSAID exposure

Helicobacter pylori	eradicated by	antibiotic therapy
antibiotic therapy	includes	clarithromycin
antibiotic therapy	includes	amoxicillin
antibiotic therapy	includes	metronidazole
triple therapy	includes	clarithromycin
triple therapy	includes	amoxicillin
triple therapy	includes	proton pump inhibitor
quadruple therapy	includes	bismuth subsalicylate
quadruple therapy	includes	tetracycline
quadruple therapy	includes	metronidazole
quadruple therapy	includes	proton pump inhibitor
proton pump inhibitor	reduces	gastric acid secretion
proton pump inhibitor	speeds	ulcer healing

gastroduodenal ulcer	treated with	proton pump inhibitors
gastroduodenal ulcer	treated with	antibiotics for H. pylori
endoscopic hemostasis	used for	bleeding gastroduodenal ulcer
bleeding risk	increased by	NSAID use
ulcer healing	monitored by	endoscopy
ulcer healing	confirmed by	follow-up endoscopy
clinical remission	achieved with	PPI therapy
PPI therapy	reduces	acid secretion
gastric mucosa	damaged by	acid exposure
ulcer size	influences	healing time
smoking cessation	improves	ulcer healing
nutrition status	influences	ulcer healing
anemia	develops from	chronic ulcer bleeding
blood loss	causes	iron deficiency anemia
iron deficiency anemia	triggers	fatigue
H. pylori eradication	reduces	ulcer recurrence
cessation of NSAIDs	reduces	ulcer risk
healing time	depends on	ulcer location
ulcer location	is either	gastric or duodenal
gastroduodenal ulcer	risk of	gastric outlet obstruction
gastric outlet obstruction	develops from	scarring
perforation risk	increased with	NSAID use
ulcer recurrence	occurs after	therapy completion

PPI therapy	associated with	nutrient deficiencies
prostaglandin analogs	used to	protect gastroduodenal mucosa
misoprostol	is a	prostaglandin analog
diagnostic criteria	include	endoscopic findings
endoscopic findings	indicate	active ulcer
ulcer healing	documented by	follow-up endoscopy
follow-up endoscopy	scheduled after	therapy completion
therapy completion	marks	treatment success
treatment failure	defined as	persistent ulcer after therapy
persistent ulcer	prompts	repeat endoscopy
repeat endoscopy	performed for	treatment failure
treatment failure	associated with	H. pylori resistance
H. pylori resistance	caused by	antibiotic misuse
antibiotic misuse	leads to	resistance
drug interactions	influence	ulcer therapy success
drug interactions	affect	ulcer therapy efficacy
adherence	predicts	eradication success
eradication success	reduces	ulcer relapse
