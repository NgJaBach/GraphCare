alcohol-related liver disease	progresses to	alcoholic hepatitis
alcoholic hepatitis	can progress to	cirrhosis
cirrhosis	causes	portal hypertension
portal hypertension	leads to	esophageal varices
esophageal varices	cause	GI bleed
ascites	occurs with	cirrhosis

hepatorenal syndrome	arises with	advanced cirrhosis
infection	risk increases with	cirrhosis
mortality	increases with	alcoholic hepatitis
mortality risk	is higher in	alcohol-related liver disease
readmission	increases with	cirrhosis
liver disease	increases	hospital admission
malnutrition	common in	alcohol-related liver disease
malnutrition	worsens	prognosis
abstinence	essential for	recovery
abstinence	improves	liver function

liver transplant	indicated for	end-stage liver disease
liver transplant	improves	survival
survival	depends on	abstinence
