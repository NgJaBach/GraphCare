cancer of other male genital organs	is treated with	chemotherapy
cancer of other male genital organs	is treated with	hormone therapy
cancer of other male genital organs	is treated with	immunotherapy
surgery	reduces	tumor burden
radiation	damages	DNA
chemotherapy	targets	rapidly dividing cells
hormone therapy	blocks	androgen receptors
immunotherapy	activates	T cells
testicular cancer	has high	cure rate
penile cancer	has poor	prognosis
prostate cancer	has high	PSA levels
epididymal cancer	is often	benign
seminal vesicle cancer	is rare	metastasis
PSA	is a	tumor marker
tumor marker	predicts	recurrence
recurrence	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	is high	in advanced stage
advanced stage	correlates with	distant metastasis
distant metastasis	occurs in	bone
distant metastasis	occurs in	liver
bone metastasis	causes	pain
liver metastasis	causes	jaundice
pain	leads to	opioid use
opioid use	increases	fall risk
fall risk	leads to	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	is influenced by	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
comorbidities	include	hypertension
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	leads to	sepsis
sepsis	increases	mortality
hypertension	increases	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	increases	mortality
tumor size	predicts	survival
tumor size	predicts	recurrence
tumor grade	predicts	aggressiveness
aggressiveness	predicts	treatment choice
treatment choice	predicts	side effects
side effects	predict	quality of life
quality of life	predicts	adherence
adherence	predicts	treatment efficacy
treatment efficacy	predicts	survival
survival	predicts	life expectancy
life expectancy	predicts	caregiver burden
caregiver burden	predicts	depression
depression	predicts	readmission
readmission	predicts	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	early detection
early detection	achieved by	screening
screening	uses	imaging
imaging	includes	MRI
imaging	includes	CT
imaging	includes	ultrasound
MRI	detects	soft tissue
CT	detects	bone lesions
ultrasound	detects	cysts
cysts	are benign	in epididymis
benign	reduces	anxiety
anxiety	reduces	adherence
adherence	reduces	recurrence
recurrence	reduces	mortality
mortality	is influenced by	age
age	influences	treatment tolerance
treatment tolerance	influences	side effect severity
side effect severity	influences	quality of life
quality of life	influences	survival
survival	is improved by	multidisciplinary care
multidisciplinary care	includes	oncology
multidisciplinary care	includes	urology
multidisciplinary care	includes	radiology
oncology	prescribes	chemotherapy
urology	performs	surgery
radiology	plans	radiation
chemotherapy	may cause	neutropenia
neutropenia	increases	infection risk
infection risk	increases	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	readmission
readmission	increases	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	prophylactic antibiotics
prophylactic antibiotics	reduce	infection
infection	reduces	survival
survival	is enhanced by	targeted therapy
targeted therapy	includes	PARP inhibitors
PARP inhibitors	treat	DNA repair deficient tumors
