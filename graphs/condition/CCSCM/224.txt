steroids	are used for	lupus management
photosensitivity	is a	symptom
photosensitivity	is seen in	systemic lupus erythematosus
kidney biopsy	is used for	lupus nephritis assessment
lupus nephritis	requires	biopsy
biopsy	provides	histology
histology	shows	immune complex deposition

biopsy	aids in	diagnosis
diagnosis	is a	process
treatment	aims for	remission
remission	is a	treatment goal
remission	reduces	disease activity
disease activity	can be measured by	SLEDAI
disease activity	predicts	flare risk
flare risk	increases with	non-adherence
non-adherence	increases	lupus activity
lupus	has comorbidity	cardiovascular disease

readmission	may occur	after hospitalization
morbidity	is a	health outcome
readmission	is a	health outcome
SLE	has	heterogeneity
lupus nephritis	has	relapses
relapses	worsen	disease activity
disease activity	worsens	organ damage
organ damage	increases	disability
disability	is a	health outcome
health outcome	includes	mortality
infection	risk	increases with immunosuppressants
immunosuppressants	require	monitoring
monitoring	ensures	early detection
early detection	improves	outcomes
outcomes	depend on	access to care
readmission	is predicted by	disease activity
disease activity	correlates with	hospital stay length
hospital stay length	increases	resource use
resource use	impacts	health care costs
health care costs	correlate with	admission rate
admission rate	is an	outcome
outcome	includes	mortality
