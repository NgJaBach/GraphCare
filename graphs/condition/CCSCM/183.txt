hypertension	is a	pregnancy complication
hypertension	increases	maternal risk
hypertension	leads to	preeclampsia
preeclampsia	is a	hypertensive disorder
preeclampsia	causes	placental abruption
placental abruption	results in	fetal distress
fetal distress	requires	emergency delivery
emergency delivery	is a	cesarean section
cesarean section	increases	postoperative pain
postoperative pain	necessitates	opioid therapy
opioid therapy	risks	respiratory depression
respiratory depression	requires	ICU admission
ICU admission	prolongs	hospital stay
hospital stay	raises	infection risk
infection risk	leads to	sepsis
sepsis	causes	organ failure
organ failure	results in	mortality
mortality	is a	adverse outcome
adverse outcome	predicts	readmission
readmission	indicates	inadequate discharge planning
discharge planning	improves	patient education
patient education	reduces	medication errors
medication errors	increase	readmission
readmission	is a	quality metric
quality metric	informs	hospital rating
hospital rating	affects	patient choice
patient choice	influences	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	determines	medication access
medication access	affects	adherence
adherence	predicts	blood pressure control
blood pressure control	reduces	hypertensive crisis
hypertensive crisis	causes	stroke
stroke	leads to	disability
disability	requires	long‑term care
long‑term care	increases	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	drives	policy change
policy change	updates	clinical guidelines
clinical guidelines	recommend	low‑dose aspirin
low‑dose aspirin	prevents	preeclampsia
preeclampsia	is prevented by	aspirin
aspirin	contraindicated in	advanced renal disease
advanced renal disease	is a	risk factor
risk factor	predicts	nephropathy
nephropathy	requires	dialysis
dialysis	increases	hospitalization
hospitalization	leads to	depression
depression	reduces	self‑management
self‑management	improves	blood pressure
blood pressure	monitored by	home BP monitor
home BP monitor	alerts	clinician
clinician alert	triggers	medication adjustment
medication adjustment	improves	BP control
BP control	reduces	cardiovascular events
cardiovascular events	cause	mortality
mortality	is a	public health concern
public health concern	prompts	screening programs
screening programs	identify	high‑risk patients
high‑risk patients	receive	antihypertensives
antihypertensives	include	labetalol
labetalol	is a	beta‑blocker
beta‑blocker	reduces	heart rate
heart rate	lowers	myocardial oxygen demand
myocardial oxygen demand	decreases	angina
angina	treated with	nitroglycerin
nitroglycerin	is a	vasodilator
vasodilator	lowers	systemic vascular resistance
systemic vascular resistance	reduces	blood pressure
blood pressure	measured by	sphygmomanometer
sphygmomanometer	requires	cuff size
cuff size	affects	accuracy
accuracy	influences	diagnosis
diagnosis	informs	treatment plan
treatment plan	includes	lifestyle modification
lifestyle modification	involves	diet
diet	follows	DASH diet
DASH diet	lowers	sodium intake
sodium intake	reduces	water retention
water retention	causes	edema
edema	indicates	fluid overload
fluid overload	treated with	diuretics
diuretics	are a	thiazide
thiazide	reduces	extracellular volume
extracellular volume	lowers	blood pressure
blood pressure	monitored in	prenatal clinic
prenatal clinic	schedules	follow‑up visits
follow‑up visits	detect	complications
complications	may include	eclampsia
eclampsia	treated with	magnesium sulfate
magnesium sulfate	prevents	seizures
seizures	cause	maternal morbidity
maternal morbidity	leads to	long‑term sequelae
long‑term sequelae	include	chronic hypertension
chronic hypertension	managed with	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	contraindicated in	pregnancy
contradiction	leads to	postpartum therapy
postpartum therapy	includes	beta‑blockers
beta‑blockers	monitored by	fetal heart rate
fetal heart rate	assessed with	Doppler
Doppler	detects	fetal growth restriction
fetal growth restriction	predicts	low birth weight
