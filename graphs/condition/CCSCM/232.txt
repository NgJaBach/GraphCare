sprain	is a	soft tissue injury
strain	is a	soft tissue injury
ligament	stabilizes	joint
tendon	connects	muscle
muscle	facilitates	movement
bone	forms	skeleton
joint	provides	stability
cartilage	cushions	joint
sprain	involves	ligament damage
strain	involves	muscle damage
swelling	accompanies	sprain
pain	accompanies	sprain
bruising	accompanies	sprain
tenderness	accompanies	sprain
ecchymosis	indicates	tissue damage
range of motion	decreases	after sprain
instability	results from	sprain
impairment	results from	sprain
functional limitation	results from	sprain
inflammation	follows	soft tissue injury
pain	is managed with	analgesics
analgesics	treat	pain
NSAIDs	reduce	inflammation
ice therapy	reduces	swelling
rest	is recommended for	sprain
immobilization	supports	healing
splint	immobilizes	ankle
brace	immobilizes	knee
physical therapy	facilitates	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	improves	ROM
ROM	returns after	healing
healing	occurs over	days to weeks
RICE protocol	is recommended for	acute sprain
RICE protocol	includes	rest
rest	provides	pain relief
physical therapy	includes	ROM exercises
ROM exercises	improve	flexibility
surgery	reserved for	ligament rupture
arthroscopic repair	used for	ligament tear
ankle sprain	may require	immobilization
knee sprain	may require	brace
imaging	assists	diagnosis
X-ray	rules out	fracture
MRI	detects	soft tissue injury
ultrasound	evaluates	ligament tear
CT	rules out	fracture
MRI	localizes	edema
edema	accompanies	sprain
hematoma	forms	soft tissue injury
recovery	depends on	injury severity
chronic instability	is a	complication of sprain
osteoarthritis	may develop	following sprain
chronic pain	persists	after sprain
nerve injury	is rare	with severe sprain
rehabilitation adherence	influences	outcome
reinjury risk	increases	with return-to-sport early
protective equipment	reduces	recurrent sprain
proprioception training	reduces	recurrent sprain
prior sprain	predisposes	to reinjury
BMI	increases	risk of sprain
age	affects	healing
obesity	increases	risk of sprain
sports	increases	sprain risk
sudden inversion	triggers	ankle sprain
weakness	persists	after sprain
chronic instability	leads to	altered gait
recovery timeline	depends on	injury severity
return-to-sport timing	depends on	rehab progress
functional tests	assess	readiness
return-to-sport	guided by	functional tests
imaging	informs	management
X-ray	rules out	fracture
ultrasound	visualizes	hematoma
edema	resolves	with healing
analgesics	provide	pain relief
NSAIDs	provide	anti-inflammatory effects
ice therapy	reduces	tissue temperature
compression	reduces	swelling
elevation	reduces	edema
immobilization	limits	motion
protective wrap	supports	ankle sprain
brace	supports	knee sprain
physical therapy	targets	proprioception
proprioception	improves	neuromuscular control
strength training	enhances	muscle strength
balance training	decreases	re-injury risk
return-to-sport criteria	include	strength tests
patient education	improves	adherence
follow-up	recommended for	persistent symptoms
red flags	include	numbness or severe swelling
chronic pain syndrome	may develop	after sprain
clinical guidelines	recommend	RICE protocol
imaging orders	include	X-ray
ultrasound	used for	dynamic assessment
MRI	used for	soft tissue visualization
fracture risk	assessed by	X-ray
prognosis	affected by	injury severity
recovery time	varies	by individual
edema	resolves	with time
joint stability	improves	with rehab
