intrauterine hypoxia	causes	fetal distress
intrauterine hypoxia	leads to	cerebral injury
intrauterine hypoxia	results in	neonatal seizures
intrauterine hypoxia	increases risk of	cerebral palsy
intrauterine hypoxia	is a risk factor for	low Apgar score
birth asphyxia	is a type of	neonatal hypoxia
birth asphyxia	causes	multi‑organ failure
birth asphyxia	leads to	hypoxic‑ischemic encephalopathy
birth asphyxia	results in	long‑term neurodevelopmental delay
birth asphyxia	is associated with	seizures
birth asphyxia	is treated with	therapeutic hypothermia
therapeutic hypothermia	reduces	mortality
therapeutic hypothermia	improves	neurocognitive outcome
therapeutic hypothermia	is initiated within	6 hours of birth
intrauterine hypoxia	is diagnosed by	fetal monitoring
fetal monitoring	includes	cardiotocography
cardiotocography	detects	late decelerations
late decelerations	indicate	uteroplacental insufficiency
uteroplacental insufficiency	causes	placental abruption
placental abruption	leads to	fetal hypoxia
fetal hypoxia	is confirmed by	fetal blood gas
fetal blood gas	shows	low pH
low pH	indicates	acidemia
acidemia	is a marker for	neonatal morbidity
neonatal morbidity	predicts	readmission
readmission	is associated with	feeding intolerance
feeding intolerance	requires	parenteral nutrition
parenteral nutrition	increases risk of	infection
infection	leads to	sepsis
sepsis	requires	antibiotics
antibiotics	include	ampicillin
ampicillin	is combined with	gentamicin
gentamicin	is nephrotoxic
nephrotoxic	causes	acute kidney injury
acute kidney injury	predicts	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	early intervention
early intervention	includes	blood transfusion
blood transfusion	is indicated for	anemia
anemia	is treated with	iron supplementation
iron supplementation	improves	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	is a predictor of	oxygen delivery
oxygen delivery	is critical for	organ perfusion
organ perfusion	is monitored by	lactate levels
lactate levels	rise in	shock
shock	requires	vasopressors
vasopressors	include	dopamine
dopamine	is used for	hypotension
hypotension	is a risk factor for	organ failure
organ failure	predicts	ICU stay
ICU stay	increases risk of	nosocomial infection
nosocomial infection	is treated with	broad‑spectrum antibiotics
broad‑spectrum antibiotics	include	ceftriaxone
ceftriaxone	is combined with	metronidazole
metronidazole	treats	anaerobic infection
anaerobic infection	is common in	necrotizing enterocolitis
necrotizing enterocolitis	is diagnosed by	abdominal X‑ray
abdominal X‑ray	shows	pneumatosis intestinalis
pneumatosis intestinalis	indicates	bowel necrosis
bowel necrosis	requires	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	is performed by	pediatric surgeon
pediatric surgeon	performs	laparotomy
laparotomy	may result in	stoma
stoma	requires	stoma care
stoma care	is managed by	wound nurse
wound nurse	monitors	wound healing
wound healing	is delayed by	infection
infection	increases	hospital cost
hospital cost	is reduced by	early discharge
early discharge	depends on	feeding tolerance
feeding tolerance	is assessed by	gastric residual volume
gastric residual volume	is measured by	bedside ultrasound
bedside ultrasound	is performed by	neonatologist
neonatologist	orders	neuroimaging
neuroimaging	includes	cranial ultrasound
cranial ultrasound	detects	intraventricular hemorrhage
intraventricular hemorrhage	is graded by	Papile scale
Papile scale	predicts	hydrocephalus
hydrocephalus	is treated with	ventriculoperitoneal shunt
ventriculoperitoneal shunt	requires	neurosurgeon
neurosurgeon	monitors	shunt function
shunt function	is evaluated by	neurosonography
neurosonography	is performed by	radiology technician
radiology technician	reports	imaging findings
imaging findings	guide	clinical decision
clinical decision	influences	prognosis
prognosis	is improved by	multidisciplinary care
multidisciplinary care	includes	neonatology	neurology	nutrition
nutrition	is managed by	dietitian
dietitian	plans	enteral feeding
enteral feeding	is started with	breast milk
breast milk	reduces	necrotizing enterocolitis
necrotizing enterocolitis	is prevented by	probiotics
probiotics	are given as	oral drops
oral drops	are administered by	nursing staff
nursing staff	document	vital signs
vital signs	are recorded in	electronic health record
electronic health record	is used for	risk scoring
risk scoring	predicts	readmission
readmission	is prevented by	follow‑up visits
follow‑up visits	are scheduled by	primary care provider
