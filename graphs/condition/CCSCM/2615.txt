primary care provider	monitors	vital signs
vital signs	are recorded by	nurse practitioner
nurse practitioner	orders	pulse oximetry

pulmonologist	prescribes	bronchodilator
bronchodilator	is a	medication
medication	is administered via	inhaler
inhaler	requires	patient education
patient education	is delivered by	pharmacist
pharmacist	reviews	medication adherence
medication adherence	predicts	therapeutic outcome
therapeutic outcome	is measured by	spirometry
spirometry	assesses	lung function

depression	is treated with	selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor	is a	drug
drug	is prescribed by	psychiatrist
psychiatrist	monitors	side effects
side effects	are reported to	adverse event reporting system
adverse event reporting system	collects	safety data
safety data	informs	pharmacovigilance
pharmacovigilance	updates	drug labels
drug labels	guide	prescribing practice
prescribing practice	is audited by	pharmacy board
pharmacy board	enforces	medication safety
medication safety	reduces	medication errors
medication errors	lower	mortality rate
mortality rate	is tracked by	public health surveillance
public health surveillance	reports	suffocation statistics
suffocation statistics	influence	injury prevention policy
injury prevention policy	mandates	safety signage
safety signage	is installed by	building inspector
building inspector	ensures	compliance
compliance	is verified by	fire marshal
fire marshal	conducts	fire safety inspection
fire safety inspection	checks	smoke detector
smoke detector	alerts	occupants
occupants	evacuate	during fire
evacuation	prevents	suffocation
suffocation	is prevented by	emergency response
emergency response	is coordinated by	emergency medical services
emergency medical services	transport	patient
patient	receives	advanced airway management
advanced airway management	performed by	emergency physician
emergency physician	orders	intubation
intubation	requires	laryngoscope
laryngoscope	is a	medical device
medical device	is sterilized by	infection control
infection control	follows	aseptic technique
aseptic technique	reduces	nosocomial infection
nosocomial infection	increases	length of stay
length of stay	predicts	cost of care
cost of care	is analyzed by	health economist
health economist	models	cost‑effectiveness
cost‑effectiveness	informs	reimbursement policy
reimbursement policy	determines	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	affects	patient access
patient access	influences	health outcomes
health outcomes	are measured by	quality‑adjusted life year
quality‑adjusted life year	is used in	health technology assessment
health technology assessment	guides	drug approval
drug approval	is granted by	FDA
FDA	reviews	clinical trial data
clinical trial data	includes	safety endpoints
safety endpoints	detect	rare adverse events
