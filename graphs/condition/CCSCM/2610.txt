transport	is a	activity
transport	involves	vehicle
transport	requires	driver
transport	uses	fuel
transport	can be	safe
transport	can be	risky
transport	may cause	injury
transport	may cause	death
transport	may cause	traffic accident
traffic accident	leads to	emergency department visit
emergency department visit	requires	triage
triage	determines	severity
severity	predicts	mortality
mortality	is a	outcome
outcome	informs	discharge planning
discharge planning	reduces	readmission
readmission	is a	quality metric
quality metric	is tracked	by hospital
hospital	reports	readmission rate
readmission rate	influences	reimbursement
reimbursement	affects	resource allocation
resource allocation	impacts	staffing
staffing	affects	patient safety
patient safety	is measured	by incident reports
incident reports	capture	adverse events
adverse events	include	transport injuries
transport injuries	classified	by type
type	includes	blunt trauma
type	includes	penetrating trauma
blunt trauma	treated with	analgesics
analgesics	include	opioids
opioids	increase	risk of overdose
overdose	leads to	respiratory depression
respiratory depression	requires	intubation
intubation	performed by	anesthesiologist
anesthesiologist	monitors	vital signs
vital signs	include	blood pressure
blood pressure	is a	predictor of shock
shock	requires	fluid resuscitation
fluid resuscitation	uses	crystalloids
crystalloids	include	saline
saline	is a	solution
solution	administered	intravenously
intravenously	delivers	medication
medication	can be	antihypertensive
antihypertensive	reduces	blood pressure
blood pressure	is monitored	by telemetry
telemetry	alerts	for arrhythmia
arrhythmia	treated with	antiarrhythmic
antiarrhythmic	includes	amiodarone
amiodarone	is a	drug
drug	has	side effect
side effect	includes	bradycardia
bradycardia	treated with	pacemaker
pacemaker	implanted	by cardiologist
cardiologist	evaluates	cardiac function
cardiac function	measured	by echocardiogram
echocardiogram	shows	ejection fraction
ejection fraction	predicts	heart failure
heart failure	managed with	diuretics
diuretics	include	furosemide
furosemide	is a	loop diuretic
loop diuretic	reduces	edema
edema	improves	mobility
mobility	is a	functional status
functional status	predicts	discharge disposition
discharge disposition	can be	home
discharge disposition	can be	skilled nursing
skilled nursing	provides	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	includes	physical therapy
physical therapy	improves	gait
gait	is a	mobility measure
mobility measure	predicts	fall risk
fall risk	leads to	injury
injury	may be	fracture
fracture	treated with	cast
cast	requires	follow‑up
follow‑up	scheduled	by orthopedist
orthopedist	monitors	healing
healing	assessed	by X‑ray
X‑ray	detects	bone union
bone union	indicates	recovery
recovery	reduces	readmission
readmission	is a	risk factor
risk factor	informs	preventive care
preventive care	includes	vaccination
vaccination	protects	against	influenza
influenza	causes	respiratory illness
respiratory illness	treated with	antiviral
antiviral	includes	oseltamivir
oseltamivir	is a	drug
drug	has	contraindication
contraindication	includes	renal impairment
renal impairment	requires	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	guided by	creatinine clearance
creatinine clearance	measured	by serum creatinine
serum creatinine	indicates	kidney function
kidney function	predicts	drug toxicity
drug toxicity	leads to	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	healthcare cost
