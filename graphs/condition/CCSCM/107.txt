cardiac arrest	is a	life‑threatening event
cardiac arrest	is caused by	ventricular fibrillation
ventricular fibrillation	is a	arrhythmia
ventricular fibrillation	is treated with	defibrillation
defibrillation	is performed by	AED
AED	is a	portable device
cardiac arrest	requires	CPR
CPR	improves	survival rate
cardiac arrest	leads to	brain hypoxia
brain hypoxia	causes	neurological damage
neuro‑protective drugs	reduce	brain injury
propofol	is a	neuro‑protective drug
cardiac arrest	increases	risk of arrhythmia
arrhythmia	is diagnosed by	ECG
ECG	shows	ST‑segment changes
ST‑segment changes	indicate	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	is treated with	PCI
PCI	is performed by	cardiologist
cardiologist	prescribes	beta‑blockers
beta‑blockers	reduce	heart rate
heart rate	is monitored by	telemetry
telemetry	alerts	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	triggers	anti‑arrhythmic therapy
anti‑arrhythmic therapy	includes	amiodarone
amiodarone	is a	class III drug
class III drug	prolongs	QT interval
QT interval	is measured by	ECG
ECG	is recorded by	cardiac monitor
cardiac monitor	displays	rhythm
rhythm	is analyzed by	arrhythmia detection algorithm
arrhythmia detection algorithm	improves	early detection
early detection	reduces	mortality
mortality	is predicted by	risk score
risk score	uses	age
risk score	uses	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	risk of cardiac arrest
cardiac arrest	is associated with	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	includes	hypokalemia
hypokalemia	is treated with	potassium supplementation
potassium supplementation	is given by	IV
IV	is administered by	nurse
nurse	monitors	potassium levels
potassium levels	are measured by	serum test
serum test	is performed by	laboratory
laboratory	reports	electrolyte panel
electrolyte panel	informs	medication adjustment
medication adjustment	reduces	arrhythmia risk
arrhythmia risk	is mitigated by	magnesium
magnesium	is a	anti‑arrhythmic
anti‑arrhythmic	is administered during	resuscitation
resuscitation	follows	ACLS protocol
ACLS protocol	is taught by	medical school
medical school	trains	emergency physician
emergency physician	manages	cardiac arrest
cardiac arrest	leads to	ICU admission
ICU admission	requires	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	is set by	ventilator
ventilator	is controlled by	respiratory therapist
respiratory therapist	monitors	oxygen saturation
oxygen saturation	is measured by	pulse oximeter
pulse oximeter	alerts	hypoxia
hypoxia	triggers	supplemental oxygen
supplemental oxygen	is delivered by	nasal cannula
nasal cannula	is used by	patient
patient	may experience	delirium
delirium	is screened by	CAM
CAM	is performed by	nurse
nurse	documents	delirium status
delirium status	influences	rehabilitation plan
rehabilitation plan	includes	physical therapy
physical therapy	improves	mobility
mobility	reduces	readmission risk
readmission risk	is predicted by	HOSPITAL score
HOSPITAL score	uses	lab values
lab values	include	creatinine
creatinine	indicates	kidney function
kidney function	is monitored by	nephrologist
nephrologist	prescribes	ACE inhibitor
ACE inhibitor	lowers	blood pressure
blood pressure	is measured by	cuff
cuff	is used by	nurse
nurse	records	blood pressure
blood pressure	is plotted on	trend chart
trend chart	is reviewed by	cardiologist
cardiologist	adjusts	medication
medication adjustment	reduces	arrhythmia risk
arrhythmia risk	is mitigated by	lifestyle changes
lifestyle changes	include	smoking cessation
smoking cessation	is advised by	primary care
primary care	follows up via	telehealth
telehealth	records	patient adherence
patient adherence	predicts	long‑term survival
long‑term survival	is influenced by	diet
diet	is guided by	dietitian
dietitian	recommends	Mediterranean diet
Mediterranean diet	reduces	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	is assessed by	Framingham score
Framingham score	uses	cholesterol levels
cholesterol levels	are measured by	lipid panel
