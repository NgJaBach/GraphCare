immunity disorders	increase	hospitalization
infections	increase	mortality
autoimmune diseases	cause	tissue damage
tissue damage	leads to	organ dysfunction
organ dysfunction	increases	mortality
immunosuppression	is associated with	infection risk
immunosuppression	increases	cancer risk

morbidity	correlates with	quality of life
quality of life	decreases with	chronic inflammation
chronic inflammation	promotes	tissue damage
tissue damage	leads to	organ failure
organ failure	increases	mortality
mortality	associated with	disease severity
disease severity	predicts	mortality
vaccination response	determines	disease prevention
disease prevention	relies on	herd immunity
herd immunity	protects	vulnerable populations
vulnerable populations	require	targeted vaccination
targeted vaccination	improves	coverage
coverage	increases	population immunity
population immunity	enhances	herd protection
herd protection	reduces	transmission
transmission	declines with	vaccination
vaccination	reduces	infection rate
infection rate	declines with	vaccination coverage
outbreaks	occur in	immunocompromised populations
immunocompromised populations	require	infection control

adverse events	occur with	immune therapies
immune therapies	cause	adverse events
cytokines	mediate	inflammatory responses
inflammatory responses	contribute to	tissue damage
tissue damage	triggers	autoimmune flares
autoimmune flares	require	systemic therapy
systemic therapy	suppresses	immune system
immune system	defends	pathogens
immune system	neutralizes	pathogens
pathogens	are cleared by	immune response
immune response	correlates with	antibody levels
antibody levels	reflect	immune status
immune status	predicts	vaccine efficacy
vaccine efficacy	varies with	immune status
immune status	influences	infection risk
infection risk	impacts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	disease severity
disease severity	drives	resource use
