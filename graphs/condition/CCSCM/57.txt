autoimmune diseases	treated with	corticosteroids
corticosteroids	are used to treat	autoimmune diseases
immunodeficiency disorders	predispose to	infections
primary immunodeficiency	is a	congenital immunodeficiency
secondary immunodeficiency	is a	acquired immunodeficiency
HIV infection	causes	secondary immunodeficiency
malnutrition	can cause	secondary immunodeficiency
immunoglobulin therapy	is used for	primary immunodeficiency
bone marrow transplantation	is used to treat	immune deficiency disorders
immune deficiency disorders	increase risk of	pneumonia
allergic diseases	are a subset of	immunity disorders
allergic diseases	include	allergic rhinitis
allergic rhinitis	presents with	nasal congestion
asthma	is a	type of allergic disease
hypersensitivity disorders	include	anaphylaxis
anaphylaxis	is triggered by	IgE-mediated reaction
IgE	is a	antibody class
allergen	triggers	immune response
immune response	involves	cytokines
cytokines	mediate	inflammation
inflammation	contributes to	tissue damage
rheumatoid arthritis	is an autoimmune disease
systemic lupus erythematosus	is an autoimmune disease
type 1 diabetes mellitus	is an autoimmune disease
multiple sclerosis	is an autoimmune disease
autoimmune diseases	show	female predominance
women	at higher risk for	autoimmune diseases
genetic predisposition	contributes to	autoimmune diseases
HLA haplotypes	associated with	autoimmune diseases
autoantibodies	are associated with	autoimmune diseases
ANA test	is used to diagnose	autoimmune diseases
diagnostic tests	include	ANA test
immunosuppressive therapy	is used for	autoimmune diseases
cyclosporine	is an	immunosuppressant
methotrexate	is used to treat	autoimmune diseases
biologic agents	are used in	autoimmune diseases
TNF inhibitors	treat	autoimmune diseases
systemic corticosteroids	suppress	immune response
infection risk	increases with	immunosuppressive therapy
immunity disorders	present with	recurrent infections
recurrent infections	lead to	hospitalization
immunity disorders	present with	fever and fatigue
fever	is a symptom of	infection
immunity disorders	associated with	autoimmune comorbidity
immunity disorders	associated with	cancer risk
immunity disorders	increase risk of	opportunistic infections
opportunistic infections	occur in	immunodeficiency
JAK inhibitors	are used to treat	autoimmune diseases
baricitinib	is a	JAK inhibitor
primary immune deficiency	presents with	recurrent infections
recurrent infections	lead to	hospitalization
immunoglobulin therapy	provides	passive immunity
passive immunity	is provided by	immunoglobulin therapy
gammaglobulinemia	is a	humoral immune deficiency
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia	occurs in	HIV infection
HIV infection	increases risk of	Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
bone marrow transplantation	can cause	immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome	occurs after	bone marrow transplantation
cytopenia	is a side effect of	immunosuppressive therapy
neutropenia	increases risk of	bacterial infections
autoimmune cytopenias	are complications of	autoimmune diseases
neuroinflammation	occurs in	multiple sclerosis
cytokine storm	can occur in	immune disorders
respiratory infections	are common in	immunodeficiency
bone marrow failure	is a feature of	immune deficiency disorders
complement deficiencies	predispose to	encapsulated bacterial infections
encapsulated bacterial infections	include	Streptococcus pneumoniae infection
checkpoints inhibitors	can cause	autoimmunity
autoimmunity	leads to	organ damage
organ damage	increases risk of	mortality
mortality risk	is increased with	severe autoimmune disease
immune tolerance	breakdown in	immunity disorders
tolerance breakdown	leads to	autoimmunity
phagocytic defects	are a subset of	primary immunodeficiencies
complement deficiencies	are a subset of	primary immunodeficiencies
SCID	is a	severe combined immunodeficiency
ADA deficiency	causes	severe combined immunodeficiency
live vaccines	are contraindicated in	severe immunodeficiency
vaccine safety	is important in	immunodeficiency
immunization schedule	should be adjusted in	immunodeficiency
immune surveillance	is reduced in	immunodeficiency
cancer risk	is increased in	immunodeficiency
immune dysregulation	drives	autoimmunity
treatment response	predicts	prognosis
prognosis	is influenced by	disease activity
disease activity	correlates with	organ damage
organ damage	leads to	disability
disability	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	improves with	effective management
effective management	reduces	complication risk
clinical guidelines	recommend	vaccination for immune disorders
mortality	remains	a concern in severe immunity disorders
