crushing injury	is a	traumatic injury
crushing injury	causes	tissue necrosis
crushing injury	leads to	compartment syndrome
compartment syndrome	requires	fasciotomy
fasciotomy	prevents	muscle death
crushing injury	results in	shock
shock	is treated with	fluid resuscitation
fluid resuscitation	improves	blood pressure
crushing injury	increases	lactate level
lactate level	predicts	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	early surgery
early surgery	improves	survival rate
crushing injury	causes	rhabdomyolysis
rhabdomyolysis	leads to	acute kidney injury
acute kidney injury	requires	dialysis
dialysis	reduces	mortality risk
crushing injury	results in	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	causes	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	treated with	antiarrhythmic drugs
antiarrhythmic drugs	prevent	sudden cardiac death
crushing injury	leads to	fat embolism
fat embolism	diagnosed by	CT scan
CT scan	detects	pulmonary embolism
pulmonary embolism	treated with	anticoagulation
anticoagulation	reduces	readmission risk
crushing injury	increases	inflammatory cytokines
inflammatory cytokines	predict	organ failure
organ failure	managed with	ICU care
ICU care	improves	ICU length of stay
crushing injury	causes	nerve damage
nerve damage	results in	neuropathic pain
neuropathic pain	treated with	gabapentin
gabapentin	reduces	opioid use
opioid use	associated with	respiratory depression
respiratory depression	prevented by	non-opioid analgesics
non-opioid analgesics	include	acetaminophen
acetaminophen	safe at	therapeutic dose
crushing injury	leads to	bone fractures
bone fractures	require	orthopedic fixation
orthopedic fixation	reduces	malunion risk
malunion risk	increases	chronic pain
chronic pain	managed with	physical therapy
physical therapy	improves	functional outcome
functional outcome	predicts	return to work
return to work	reduces	socioeconomic burden
crushing injury	causes	soft tissue loss
soft tissue loss	treated with	skin graft
skin graft	improves	wound healing
wound healing	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	mitigated by	prophylactic antibiotics
prophylactic antibiotics	reduce	sepsis incidence
sepsis incidence	lowers	mortality
crushing injury	increases	blood loss
blood loss	requires	blood transfusion
blood transfusion	associated with	transfusion reactions
transfusion reactions	prevented by	crossmatching
crossmatching	ensures	compatibility
compatibility	reduces	transfusion complications
transfusion complications	lower	ICU mortality
crushing injury	leads to	hypothermia
hypothermia	treated with	warming blankets
warming blankets	prevent	coagulopathy
coagulopathy	managed with	plasma transfusion
plasma transfusion	improves	clotting factors
clotting factors	reduce	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	decreases	reoperation rate
reoperation rate	correlates with	hospital stay
hospital stay	predicts	readmission
readmission	associated with	poor outcome
poor outcome	linked to	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	mitigated by	glycemic control
glycemic control	achieved with	insulin therapy
insulin therapy	reduces	wound complications
wound complications	lower	mortality
mortality	influenced by	age
age	predicts	survival probability
survival probability	informs	discharge planning
discharge planning	involves	home health services
home health services	reduce	readmission
readmission	prevented by	patient education
patient education	improves	medication adherence
medication adherence	lowers	relapse rate
relapse rate	decreases	long-term morbidity
long-term morbidity	measured by	quality of life
quality of life	assessed with	SF‑36
SF‑36	predicts	functional independence
functional independence	correlates with	community participation
community participation	enhances	mental health
mental health	supports	rehabilitation adherence
rehabilitation adherence	improves	outcome
outcome	reflected in	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	linked to	hospital reputation
hospital reputation	affects	patient volume
patient volume	influences	resource allocation
resource allocation	determines	staff-to-patient ratio
staff-to-patient ratio	impacts	quality of care
quality of care	reduces	adverse events
adverse events	lower	overall mortality
