peripheral atherosclerosis	is a	cardiovascular disease
visceral atherosclerosis	is a	cardiovascular disease
atherosclerosis	causes	arterial stenosis
arterial stenosis	leads to	ischemia
ischemia	results in	tissue damage
tissue damage	increases risk of	infection
infection	may cause	sepsis
sepsis	predicts	mortality
arterial stenosis	predicts	heart failure
heart failure	predicts	readmission
peripheral atherosclerosis	is associated with	claudication
claudication	indicates	reduced blood flow
reduced blood flow	predicts	ulcer formation
ulcer formation	requires	wound care
wound care	reduces	amputation risk
amputation risk	predicts	mortality
visceral atherosclerosis	is linked to	mesenteric ischemia
mesenteric ischemia	causes	abdominal pain
abdominal pain	leads to	emergency surgery
emergency surgery	increases	postoperative complications
postoperative complications	predict	readmission
atherosclerosis	is a risk factor for	stroke
stroke	predicts	long‑term disability
long‑term disability	predicts	mortality
atherosclerosis	is associated with	hypertension
hypertension	is treated with	beta‑blockers
beta‑blockers	reduce	mortality
beta‑blockers	increase	adherence
adherence	predicts	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	readmission
atherosclerosis	is associated with	hyperlipidemia
hyperlipidemia	is treated with	statins
statins	reduce	LDL
LDL	predicts	plaque progression
plaque progression	predicts	restenosis
restenosis	requires	angioplasty
angioplasty	reduces	restenosis
restenosis	predicts	mortality
angioplasty	is a	minimally invasive procedure
minimally invasive procedure	reduces	hospital stay
hospital stay	predicts	readmission
atherosclerosis	is associated with	diabetes
diabetes	is treated with	insulin
insulin	reduces	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	predicts	infection
infection	predicts	readmission
diabetes	increases	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	predicts	mortality
atherosclerosis	is associated with	obesity
obesity	is treated with	lifestyle modification
lifestyle modification	reduces	weight
weight	predicts	blood pressure
blood pressure	predicts	stroke
stroke	predicts	mortality
atherosclerosis	is associated with	smoking
smoking	increases	plaque formation
plaque formation	predicts	restenosis
restenosis	predicts	mortality
smoking	is treated with	nicotine replacement
nicotine replacement	reduces	relapse
relapse	predicts	readmission
atherosclerosis	is associated with	chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease	predicts	cardiovascular events
cardiovascular events	predict	mortality
chronic kidney disease	is treated with	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	reduce	proteinuria
proteinuria	predicts	progression
progression	predicts	mortality
atherosclerosis	is associated with	inflammation
inflammation	is measured by	CRP
CRP	predicts	plaque rupture
plaque rupture	causes	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	predicts	mortality
myocardial infarction	treated with	thrombolytics
thrombolytics	reduce	infarct size
infarct size	predicts	heart failure
heart failure	predicts	readmission
atherosclerosis	is associated with	endothelial dysfunction
endothelial dysfunction	predicts	atherogenesis
atherogenesis	predicts	plaque burden
plaque burden	predicts	restenosis
restenosis	predicts	mortality
atherosclerosis	is associated with	platelet activation
platelet activation	is treated with	antiplatelets
antiplatelets	reduce	thrombus formation
thrombus formation	predicts	stroke
stroke	predicts	mortality
atherosclerosis	is associated with	oxidative stress
oxidative stress	is measured by	malondialdehyde
malondialdehyde	predicts	endothelial dysfunction
endothelial dysfunction	predicts	atherogenesis
atherogenesis	predicts	plaque progression
plaque progression	predicts	restenosis
restenosis	predicts	mortality
peripheral atherosclerosis	is treated with	supervised exercise
supervised exercise	improves	walking distance
walking distance	predicts	quality of life
quality of life	predicts	mortality
visceral atherosclerosis	is treated with	dietary modification
dietary modification	reduces	cholesterol
