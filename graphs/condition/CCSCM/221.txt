respiratory distress syndrome	is a	neonatal disease
respiratory distress syndrome	is caused by	surfactant deficiency
surfactant deficiency	leads to	alveolar collapse
alveolar collapse	causes	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	results in	cyanosis
cyanosis	indicates	low oxygen saturation
low oxygen saturation	triggers	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	is delivered by	CPAP
CPAP	is a type of	noninvasive ventilation
noninvasive ventilation	reduces	work of breathing
work of breathing	is measured by	respiratory rate
respiratory rate	is monitored by	pulse oximetry
pulse oximetry	measures	SpO₂
SpO₂	is a marker for	oxygenation status
oxygenation status	is improved by	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	uses	positive pressure
positive pressure	increases	alveolar recruitment
alveolar recruitment	decreases	atelectasis
atelectasis	is seen on	chest X‑ray
chest X‑ray	shows	ground‑glass opacity
ground‑glass opacity	indicates	pulmonary edema
pulmonary edema	is treated with	diuretics
diuretics	are a class of	loop diuretics
loop diuretics	include	furosemide
furosemide	is administered by	intravenous route
intravenous route	is used for	rapid effect
rapid effect	is needed in	severe respiratory distress
severe respiratory distress	predicts	mortality risk
mortality risk	is stratified by	Apgar score
Apgar score	is assessed at	5 minutes
5 minutes	is a time point for	neonatal assessment
neonatal assessment	includes	blood gas analysis
blood gas analysis	measures	PaCO₂
PaCO₂	indicates	ventilation status
ventilation status	is optimized by	ventilator settings
ventilator settings	include	tidal volume
tidal volume	is calculated by	body weight
body weight	is recorded in	neonatal chart
neonatal chart	is scanned by	electronic health record
electronic health record	stores	medication orders
medication orders	contain	surfactant therapy
surfactant therapy	is a treatment for	respiratory distress syndrome
treatment	is administered by	endotracheal tube
endotracheal tube	is placed during	intubation
intubation	is performed by	neonatal surgeon
neonatal surgeon	collaborates with	neonatologist
neonatologist	prescribes	caffeine therapy
caffeine therapy	reduces	apnea episodes
apnea episodes	are monitored by	pulse oximetry
pulse oximetry	alerts for	desaturation
desaturation	triggers	supplemental oxygen
supplemental oxygen	is titrated to	target SpO₂
target SpO₂	is set by	clinical guidelines
clinical guidelines	recommend	90–95% range
90–95% range	is associated with	reduced morbidity
reduced morbidity	leads to	shorter NICU stay
shorter NICU stay	decreases	readmission risk
readmission risk	is predicted by	discharge planning
discharge planning	includes	home oxygen therapy
home oxygen therapy	is monitored by	telehealth
telehealth	collects	vital signs
vital signs	are analyzed by	predictive model
predictive model	forecasts	mortality risk
mortality risk	informs	family counseling
family counseling	improves	satisfaction score
satisfaction score	is recorded in	quality metrics
quality metrics	influence	reimbursement rates
reimbursement rates	affect	hospital funding
hospital funding	supports	research grants
research grants	fund	clinical trials
clinical trials	evaluate	new surfactant formulations
new surfactant formulations	are tested in	phase III studies
phase III studies	require	multicenter collaboration
multicenter collaboration	uses	standardized protocols
standardized protocols	reduce	variability
variability	improves	data quality
data quality	enhances	machine learning models
machine learning models	predict	treatment response
treatment response	guides	personalized therapy
personalized therapy	optimizes	oxygenation
oxygenation	is monitored by	arterial blood gas
arterial blood gas	measures	pH
pH	indicates	acid–base balance
acid–base balance	is corrected by	bicarbonate therapy
bicarbonate therapy	is given when	pH < 7.2
pH < 7.2	is a sign of	severe acidosis
severe acidosis	predicts	need for ECMO
ECMO	is a rescue therapy for	refractory respiratory failure
refractory respiratory failure	is defined by	persistent hypoxemia
persistent hypoxemia	is measured by	PaO₂
PaO₂	is calculated from	arterial blood gas
arterial blood gas	is drawn via	arterial line
arterial line	is placed by	interventionalist
interventionalist	performs	catheterization
catheterization	requires	fluoroscopy
fluoroscopy	exposes to	radiation
radiation exposure	is minimized by	low‑dose protocol
low‑dose protocol	reduces	fetal risk
fetal risk	is monitored by	ultrasound
ultrasound	assesses	fetal growth
