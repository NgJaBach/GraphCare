respiratory distress syndrome	is a	neonatal lung disease
respiratory distress syndrome	is a	lung disease
respiratory distress syndrome	is caused by	surfactant deficiency
surfactant deficiency	causes	respiratory distress syndrome
surfactant	treats	respiratory distress syndrome
surfactant therapy	is used for	respiratory distress syndrome
respiratory distress syndrome	requires	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	is used for	respiratory distress syndrome
respiratory distress syndrome	is managed with	ventilation
ventilation	is used for	respiratory distress syndrome
ventilation	provides	respiratory support
respiratory support	is used for	respiratory distress syndrome
gas exchange	is impaired in	respiratory distress syndrome
gas exchange	improves with	ventilation
alveolar collapse	occurs in	respiratory distress syndrome
alveolar collapse	contributes to	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	worsens	respiratory distress syndrome
hypoxemia	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	increases	respiratory distress syndrome
respiratory distress syndrome	increases	length of stay
length of stay	correlates with	hospital cost
hospital cost	increases with	respiratory distress syndrome
neonate	requires	surfactant therapy
neonates	require	oxygen therapy
neonates	require	ventilation
oxygen therapy	reduces	hypoxemia
ventilation	reduces	hypercapnia
hypercapnia	occurs in	respiratory distress syndrome
hypercapnia	worsens	hypoxemia
CPAP therapy	is used for	mild respiratory distress syndrome
CPAP therapy	reduces	need for intubation
intubation	increases	risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia
ventilator-associated pneumonia	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	associated with	prematurity
prematurity	is a risk factor for	respiratory distress syndrome
oxygen toxicity	is a potential complication of	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	requires	monitoring
monitoring	is necessary for	respiratory distress syndrome
monitoring	includes	blood gas analysis
blood gas analysis	informs	oxygenation management
oxygenation management	includes	FiO2 adjustment
FiO2 adjustment	is controlled by	clinician
clinician	manages	respiratory distress syndrome
neonatal intensive care unit	cares for	respiratory distress syndrome
neonatal intensive care unit	provides	supportive care
supportive care	includes	respiratory therapy
respiratory therapy	includes	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	reduces	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	worsens	tissue hypoxia
tissue hypoxia	affects	organ function
organ function	reflects	disease severity
disease severity	predicts	prognosis
prognosis	foretells	outcome
outcome	drives	clinical decisions
clinical decisions	influenced by	prognosis
prognosis	used for	resource planning
resource planning	aims to reduce	length of stay
length of stay	affects	hospital reimbursement
hospital reimbursement	impacts	hospital finances
finances	influence	healthcare access
healthcare access	affects	patient outcomes
outcomes	linked to	respiratory distress syndrome
outcomes	determine	discharge planning
discharge planning	depends on	prognosis
prognosis	used for	triage
triage	informs	treatment plan
treatment plan	guides	care pathway
care pathway	shaped by	disease severity
disease severity	influences	treatment intensity
treatment intensity	correlates with	mortality
mortality	correlates with	respiratory distress syndrome
respiratory distress syndrome	contributes to	respiratory failure
respiratory failure	requires	ventilatory support
ventilatory support	is delivered by	ventilator
ventilator	is set to	PEEP
PEEP	improves	oxygenation
oxygenation	improves with	PEEP
surfactant	reduces	alveolar surface tension
alveolar surface tension	influences	alveolar stability
alveolar stability	reduces	work of breathing
work of breathing	increases	oxygen consumption
oxygen consumption	increases	metabolic demand
metabolic demand	increases	energy expenditure
care team	monitors	respiratory status
respiratory status	informs	management plan
planning	requires	ventilator weaning
ventilator weaning	facilitates	extubation
extubation	decreases	ICU length of stay
ICU length of stay	determines	resource allocation
resource allocation	aims to optimize	patient flow
patient flow	affects	hospital throughput
throughput	influences	cost efficiency
cost efficiency	improves	care delivery
care delivery	improves	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	improve	overall prognosis
prognosis	informs	family counseling
family counseling	requires	prognosis
prognosis	guides	discharge decisions
discharge decisions	depend on	prognosis
prognosis	influences	readmission rates
