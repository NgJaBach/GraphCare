epilepsy	is a	neurological disorder
epilepsy	causes	convulsions
convulsions	are a	seizure type
seizure	is a	neurological event
seizure	can be	focal
seizure	can be	generalized
focal seizure	may cause	aura
generalized seizure	may cause	loss of consciousness
epilepsy	is diagnosed with	EEG
EEG	records	brain activity
brain activity	shows	abnormal spikes
abnormal spikes	indicate	epileptiform activity
epileptiform activity	is a	seizure marker
epilepsy	is treated with	antiepileptic drugs
antiepileptic drug	is a	medication
antiepileptic drug	includes	valproate
antiepileptic drug	includes	carbamazepine
antiepileptic drug	includes	levetiracetam
antiepileptic drug	includes	phenytoin
antiepileptic drug	includes	lamotrigine
antiepileptic drug	may cause	weight gain
antiepileptic drug	may cause	rash
antiepileptic drug	may cause	cognitive impairment
antiepileptic drug	may cause	liver toxicity
antiepileptic drug	may cause	teratogenicity
antiepileptic drug	is monitored by	serum level
serum level	is measured with	blood test
blood test	detects	drug concentration
drug concentration	guides	dosage adjustment
dosage adjustment	improves	seizure control
seizure control	reduces	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	healthcare cost
epilepsy	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	is due to	SUDEP
SUDEP	stands for	sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
SUDEP	is prevented by	seizure control
seizure control	is achieved with	medication adherence
medication adherence	is measured by	pill count
pill count	predicts	readmission risk
readmission risk	is high for	refractory epilepsy
refractory epilepsy	is defined by	drug resistance
drug resistance	is diagnosed with	failure of two drugs
failure of two drugs	leads to	surgical evaluation
surgical evaluation	includes	neuroimaging
neuroimaging	uses	MRI
MRI	identifies	epileptogenic focus
epileptogenic focus	is targeted by	resective surgery
resective surgery	improves	seizure freedom
seizure freedom	reduces	medication burden
medication burden	lowers	side effect risk
side effect risk	includes	depression
depression	is comorbid with	epilepsy
comorbidity	increases	quality‑of‑life impairment
quality‑of‑life impairment	is measured by	QOLIE‑31
QOLIE‑31	predicts	functional status
functional status	predicts	employment outcome
employment outcome	is affected by	seizure frequency
seizure frequency	is reduced by	lifestyle modification
lifestyle modification	includes	sleep hygiene
sleep hygiene	reduces	seizure triggers
seizure triggers	include	alcohol
alcohol	is contraindicated with	carbamazepine
carbamazepine	interacts with	warfarin
warfarin	requires	INR monitoring
INR monitoring	is performed with	point‑of‑care test
point‑of‑care test	improves	anticoagulation control
anticoagulation control	reduces	stroke risk
stroke risk	is elevated in	epilepsy
epilepsy	is associated with	cognitive decline
cognitive decline	is assessed by	MoCA
MoCA	predicts	driving safety
driving safety	is regulated by	seizure‑free period
seizure‑free period	is required for	license renewal
license renewal	affects	social mobility
social mobility	influences	mental health
mental health	is monitored by	PHQ‑9
PHQ‑9	identifies	depression severity
depression severity	guides	psychotherapy referral
psychotherapy referral	improves	coping skills
coping skills	reduce	seizure stress
seizure stress	triggers	seizures
seizure triggers	include	stress
stress	is measured by	cortisol level
cortisol level	is obtained from	saliva test
saliva test	is non‑invasive
non‑invasive	increases	patient adherence
patient adherence	is predicted by	mobile app usage
mobile app usage	tracks	medication reminders
medication reminders	improve	adherence
adherence	reduces	breakthrough seizures
breakthrough seizures	increase	emergency visits
emergency visits	predict	ICU admission
ICU admission	is costly
costly	leads to	insurance claim
insurance claim	affects	socioeconomic status
socioeconomic status	influences	access to care
access to care	determines	treatment options
treatment options	include	ketogenic diet
ketogenic diet	reduces	seizure frequency
seizure frequency	improves	overall prognosis
