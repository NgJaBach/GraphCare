caregiver burden	increases	psychosocial stress
epilepsy	affects	sleep quality
sleep quality	influences	seizure control
epilepsy	associated with	cognitive decline
antiseizure drugs withdrawal	risks	seizure recurrence
antiseizure drugs	require	periodic monitoring
liver function tests	monitor	valproate therapy
valproate therapy	requires	liver function monitoring
healthcare costs	rise with	uncontrolled seizures
uncontrolled seizures	lead to	hospital admission
hospital admission	associated with	status epilepticus
epilepsy management guidelines	recommend	regular review
regular review	improves	treatment adherence
seizure onset	occurs at	age
age	influences	epilepsy subtype distribution
