diabetes	is a	metabolic disorder
abnormal glucose tolerance	is a	gestational condition
pregnancy	increases	insulin resistance
childbirth	triggers	hormonal shift
puerperium	is a	postpartum period
diabetes	causes	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	leads to	fetal macrosomia
fetal macrosomia	increases	cesarean risk
gestational diabetes	requires	glucose monitoring
glucose monitoring	predicts	neonatal hypoglycemia
neonatal hypoglycemia	treated with	glucose infusion
glucose infusion	prevents	seizures
seizures	increase	NICU admission
NICU admission	raises	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	predicts	readmission risk
readmission risk	is a	quality metric
quality metric	influences	hospital rating
hospital rating	affects	patient choice
patient choice	determines	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	impacts	medication adherence
medication adherence	predicts	glycemic control
glycemic control	reduces	maternal complications
maternal complications	include	preeclampsia
preeclampsia	is a	hypertensive disorder
hypertensive disorder	treated with	magnesium sulfate
magnesium sulfate	prevents	eclampsia
eclampsia	leads to	seizures
seizures	require	ICU care
ICU care	increases	length of stay
length of stay	predicts	cost burden
cost burden	correlates	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	influences	readmission
readmission	is a	adverse outcome
adverse outcome	reduces	survival rate
survival rate	is a	mortality predictor
mortality predictor	used in	risk scoring
risk scoring	guides	treatment intensity
treatment intensity	includes	insulin therapy
insulin therapy	requires	patient education
patient education	improves	self‑management
self‑management	lowers	glucose variability
glucose variability	reduces	vascular risk
vascular risk	includes	neuropathy
neuropathy	leads to	foot ulcer
foot ulcer	necessitates	amputation
amputation	increases	mortality
mortality	is a	public health indicator
public health indicator	informs	policy
policy	sets	screening guidelines
screening guidelines	recommend	OGTT
OGTT	detects	gestational diabetes
gestational diabetes	treated with	diet
diet	requires	carbohydrate counting
carbohydrate counting	improves	glycemic control
glycemic control	reduces	macrosomia
macrosomia	decreases	shoulder dystocia
shoulder dystocia	requires	manual maneuver
manual maneuver	reduces	neonatal injury
neonatal injury	lowers	morbidity
morbidity	is a	outcome measure
outcome measure	used in	quality improvement
quality improvement	targets	readmission reduction
readmission reduction	achieved by	discharge planning
discharge planning	includes	medication reconciliation
medication reconciliation	prevents	drug errors
drug errors	cause	adverse drug events
adverse drug events	increase	hospitalization
hospitalization	predicts	future readmission
future readmission	is a	risk factor
risk factor	informs	prophylactic therapy
prophylactic therapy	includes	aspirin
aspirin	reduces	preeclampsia
preeclampsia	reduces	maternal mortality
maternal mortality	is a	health metric
health metric	guides	resource allocation
resource allocation	affects	staffing levels
staffing levels	influence	patient monitoring
patient monitoring	detects	hypoglycemia
hypoglycemia	treated with	glucagon
glucagon	prevents	seizures
seizures	require	emergency care
emergency care	increases	cost
cost	drives	insurance premiums
insurance premiums	affect	access to care
access to care	determines	disease progression
disease progression	predicts	long‑term complications
long‑term complications	include	retinopathy
retinopathy	leads to	vision loss
vision loss	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	is a	patient‑reported outcome
patient‑reported outcome	used in	clinical trials
clinical trials	test	new therapies
new therapies	may include	GLP‑1 agonists
GLP‑1 agonists	improve	insulin sensitivity
insulin sensitivity	lowers	glucose levels
glucose levels	reduce	fetal distress
fetal distress	requires	emergency C‑section
emergency C‑section	increases	operative risk
operative risk	predicts	postoperative complications
postoperative complications	are a	readmission trigger
