postpartum hemorrhage	is a	obstetric emergency
postpartum hemorrhage	requires	uterine massage
uterine massage	reduces	bleeding
postpartum hemorrhage	treated with	oxytocin
oxytocin	is a	uterotonic
uterotonic	increases	uterine tone
uterine tone	prevents	hemorrhage
postpartum hemorrhage	can cause	hypovolemic shock
hypovolemic shock	leads to	organ failure
organ failure	increases	mortality
postpartum hemorrhage	diagnosed by	blood loss
blood loss	measured by	uterine cavity
uterine cavity	assessed with	ultrasound
ultrasound	detects	retained placenta
retained placenta	causes	hemorrhage
retained placenta	treated with	manual removal
manual removal	performed by	obstetrician
obstetrician	may prescribe	tranexamic acid
tranexamic acid	is a	antifibrinolytic
antifibrinolytic	reduces	bleeding
postpartum hemorrhage	associated with	anemia
anemia	managed with	iron supplementation
iron supplementation	improves	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	indicates	anemia severity
anemia severity	predicts	readmission risk
readmission risk	increased by	postpartum complications
postpartum complications	include	infection
infection	diagnosed by	fever
fever	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	selected by	culture sensitivity
culture sensitivity	guides	antibiotic choice
antibiotic choice	affects	resistance
resistance	leads to	treatment failure
treatment failure	increases	morbidity
morbidity	predicts	mortality
mortality	influenced by	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	hypertension
hypertension	managed with	antihypertensives
antihypertensives	include	labetalol
labetalol	reduces	blood pressure
blood pressure	monitored by	sphygmomanometer
sphygmomanometer	measures	systolic pressure
systolic pressure	indicates	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	predicts	readmission
readmission	associated with	postpartum depression
postpartum depression	screened by	Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
EPDS	identifies	depressive symptoms
depressive symptoms	treated with	psychotherapy
psychotherapy	improves	mood
mood	affects	adherence
adherence	influences	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	complications
complications	include	uterine atony
uterine atony	treated with	misoprostol
misoprostol	is a	prostaglandin analogue
prostaglandin analogue	increases	uterine contractions
uterine contractions	reduce	bleeding
bleeding	monitored by	vital signs
vital signs	include	heart rate
heart rate	increases	during hemorrhage
hemorrhage	leads to	tachycardia
tachycardia	indicates	volume loss
volume loss	treated with	fluid resuscitation
fluid resuscitation	uses	crystalloids
crystalloids	restore	intravascular volume
intravascular volume	stabilizes	blood pressure
blood pressure	stabilizes	organ perfusion
organ perfusion	prevents	organ dysfunction
organ dysfunction	predicts	ICU admission
ICU admission	increases	cost
cost	affects	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	measured by	length of stay
length of stay	correlates with	readmission
readmission	influenced by	discharge planning
discharge planning	includes	follow‑up visits
follow‑up visits	scheduled by	primary care
primary care	monitors	blood glucose
blood glucose	relevant for	gestational diabetes
gestational diabetes	managed with	diet
diet	prescribed by	dietitian
dietitian	advises	carbohydrate counting
carbohydrate counting	reduces	glucose spikes
glucose spikes	decrease	postpartum complications
postpartum complications	include	mastitis
mastitis	diagnosed by	breast pain
breast pain	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	selected by	pathogen
pathogen	identified by	culture
culture	informs	antibiotic stewardship
antibiotic stewardship	reduces	resistance
resistance	lowers	treatment cost
treatment cost	impacts	patient adherence
patient adherence	affects	recovery
recovery	measured by	functional status
functional status	assessed by	Barthel Index
Barthel Index	predicts	independence
independence	reduces	caregiver burden
caregiver burden	linked to	mental health
mental health	improves	quality of life
quality of life	predicts	long‑term outcomes
