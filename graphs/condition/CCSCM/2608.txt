pedal cyclist	linked to	head injury
head injury	increases	hospitalization
hospitalization	lengthens	length of stay
length of stay	predicts	hospital cost
hospital cost	drives	payer decisions
pedal cyclist	connected to	concussion
concussion	raises	mortality risk
mortality risk	correlates with	age
age	influences	mortality
bicycle crash	leads to	fracture
fracture	requires	immobilization
immobilization	reduces	mobility
mobility	affects	independence
independence	declines in	elderly patients
elderly patients	have	higher mortality
bicycle crash	causes	limb fracture
limb fracture	treated by	orthopedics
orthopedics	manages	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	shortens	length of stay
length of stay	influences	hospital throughput
throughput	improves	ED efficiency
ED efficiency	reduces	wait time
wait time	impacts	patient satisfaction
pedal cyclist	appears in	emergency department record
emergency department record	contains	injury profile
injury profile	informs	risk scoring
risk scoring	supports	triage decisions
risk scoring	predicts	readmission
readmission	indicates	complication
complication	raises	ICU admission
ICU admission	extends	ICU stay
ICU stay	increases	hospital cost
bicycle crash	more common in	urban areas
urban areas	have	higher traffic exposure
traffic exposure	relates to	crash severity
crash severity	predicts	mortality
external cause code	assists	injury surveillance
injury surveillance	enhances	public health response
public health response	informs	prevention policy
prevention policy	reduces	bicycle crashes
bicycle crashes	are recorded in	trauma registry
trauma registry	provides	patient-level data
patient-level data	enables	risk adjustment
risk adjustment	improves	benchmarking
pedal cyclist	included in	demographic data
demographic data	covers	age distribution
age distribution	affects	injury risk
injury risk	varies by	sex
sex	influences	injury pattern
injury pattern	guides	imaging decisions
imaging decisions	depend on	mechanism
mechanism	described as	nontraffic
nontraffic	describes	bicycle crashes
bicycle crashes	produce	head injuries
head injuries	cause	coma
coma	necessitates	intubation
intubation	lengthens	ICU stay
ICU stay	drives	hospital resource use
hospital resource use	determines	staffing
staffing	affects	patient care quality
patient care quality	ties to	outcomes
outcomes	include	survival
survival	linked to	rapid rehab
rapid rehab	improves	functional outcomes
functional outcomes	tracked by	outcome scores
outcome scores	used for	risk stratification
risk stratification	informs	discharge planning
discharge planning	reduces	readmission
readmission	linked to	home support
home support	influences	recovery pace
recovery pace	varies with	comorbidity
comorbidity	elevates	mortality risk
mortality risk	higher in	elderly patients
elderly patients	require	gait training
gait training	delivered by	physiotherapy
physiotherapy	improves	mobility
mobility	influences	independence level
independence level	affects	caregiver burden
caregiver burden	associated with	home discharge
home discharge	requires	social work assessment
social work assessment	guides	discharge destination
discharge destination	includes	home
home	reduces	hospital bed occupancy
hospital bed occupancy	affects	hospital revenue
hospital revenue	supports	healthcare investment
healthcare investment	improves	infrastructure
infrastructure	enables	faster imaging
faster imaging	reduces	time to diagnosis
time to diagnosis	improves	prognosis
prognosis	depends on	injury severity
injury severity	assessed by	scoring system
scoring system	influences	treatment choice
