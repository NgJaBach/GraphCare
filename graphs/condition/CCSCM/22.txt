TNM system	includes	tumor size
TNM system	includes	nodal status
TNM system	includes	metastasis
melanomas of skin	is treated with	surgical excision
surgical excision	requires	wide margins
wide margins	are measured in	centimeters
melanomas of skin	may be treated with	sentinel lymph node biopsy
sentinel lymph node biopsy	detects	micrometastasis
melanomas of skin	may be treated with	immunotherapy
immunotherapy	includes	checkpoint inhibitors
checkpoint inhibitors	target	PD‑1
checkpoint inhibitors	target	CTLA‑4
melanomas of skin	may be treated with	targeted therapy
targeted therapy	targets	BRAF mutation
BRAF mutation	is found in	~50% of melanomas
melanomas of skin	may be treated with	radiation therapy
radiation therapy	is used for	palliative care
melanomas of skin	may be treated with	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	is less effective than	immunotherapy
melanomas of skin	has risk factor	UV exposure
UV exposure	increases risk of	DNA damage
DNA damage	leads to	mutations
melanomas of skin	has risk factor	fair skin
fair skin	is associated with	low melanin
melanomas of skin	has risk factor	family history
family history	indicates	genetic predisposition
genetic predisposition	includes	CDKN2A mutation
CDKN2A mutation	increases risk of	melanoma
melanomas of skin	has risk factor	immunosuppression
immunosuppression	increases risk of	skin cancers
melanomas of skin	has risk factor	chronic sunburns
chronic sunburns	cause	actinic keratosis
actinic keratosis	can progress to	squamous cell carcinoma
melanomas of skin	is associated with	sunburn history
melanomas of skin	is associated with	tanning beds
tanning beds	emit	UVA radiation
UVA radiation	penetrates	dermis
melanomas of skin	is associated with	age
age	increases risk after	50 years
melanomas of skin	is associated with	gender
gender	shows higher incidence in	men
melanomas of skin	is associated with	ethnicity
ethnicity	shows higher incidence in	Caucasians
melanomas of skin	is associated with	nevus count
nevus count	is a predictor of	melanoma risk
melanomas of skin	is associated with	atypical nevi
atypical nevi	are screened by	dermoscopy
dermoscopy	improves detection of	melanoma
melanomas of skin	is associated with	Clark level
Clark level	measures	depth of invasion
depth of invasion	predicts	prognosis
prognosis	is influenced by	mitotic rate
mitotic rate	is counted per	mm²
melanomas of skin	is associated with	ulceration
ulceration	worsens	survival
melanomas of skin	is associated with	regression
regression	may mask	tumor size
melanomas of skin	is associated with	tumor thickness
tumor thickness	is measured by	Breslow depth
Breslow depth	predicts	recurrence
recurrence	increases risk of	metastasis
metastasis	commonly occurs in	lymph nodes
metastasis	commonly occurs in	lungs
metastasis	commonly occurs in	liver
metastasis	commonly occurs in	brain
melanomas of skin	is associated with	sentinel node positivity
sentinel node positivity	indicates	need for completion lymph node dissection
completion lymph node dissection	reduces	recurrence
melanomas of skin	is associated with	BRAF V600E mutation
BRAF V600E mutation	is targeted by	vemurafenib
vemurafenib	is a	kinase inhibitor
melanomas of skin	is associated with	NRAS mutation
NRAS mutation	is targeted by	MEK inhibitors
MEK inhibitors	include	trametinib
melanomas of skin	is associated with	KIT mutation
KIT mutation	is targeted by	imatinib
melanomas of skin	is associated with	PD‑L1 expression
PD‑L1 expression	predicts	response to pembrolizumab
pembrolizumab	is a	PD‑1 inhibitor
melanomas of skin	is associated with	tumor mutational burden
tumor mutational burden	predicts	immunotherapy response
melanomas of skin	is associated with	sun protection
sun protection	reduces	incidence
sun protection	includes	sunscreen
sunscreen	blocks	UVB radiation
UVB radiation	causes	sunburn
melanomas of skin	is associated with	early detection
early detection	improves	survival
melanomas of skin	is associated with	patient education
patient education	focuses on	self‑skin exam
self‑skin exam	detects	new lesions
new lesions	are evaluated by	dermatologist
dermatologist	performs	excisional biopsy
