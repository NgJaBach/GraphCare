hemolytic jaundice	is a	jaundice type
perinatal jaundice	is a	jaundice type
hemolytic jaundice	causes	hyperbilirubinemia
perinatal jaundice	causes	hyperbilirubinemia
hyperbilirubinemia	leads to	neurotoxicity
neurotoxicity	results in	kernicterus
kernicterus	is a	neurological injury
hemolytic jaundice	is caused by	hemolysis
perinatal jaundice	is caused by	immature liver
hemolysis	increases	bilirubin production
immature liver	decreases	bilirubin conjugation
bilirubin conjugation	is performed by	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	is deficient in	Crigler–Najjar syndrome
Crigler–Najjar syndrome	is a	genetic disorder
hemolytic jaundice	may be due to	ABO incompatibility
hemolytic jaundice	may be due to	Rh incompatibility
ABO incompatibility	is a	blood group mismatch
Rh incompatibility	is a	blood group mismatch
blood group mismatch	triggers	immune hemolysis
immune hemolysis	increases	reticulocyte count
reticulocyte count	is measured by	CBC
CBC	is a	laboratory test
hemolytic jaundice	is diagnosed by	direct Coombs test
direct Coombs test	detects	autoantibodies
autoantibodies	bind to	red blood cells
red blood cells	undergo	hemolysis
perinatal jaundice	is screened by	transcutaneous bilirubinometry
transcutaneous bilirubinometry	measures	bilirubin level
bilirubin level	is quantified by	serum bilirubin
serum bilirubin	is measured by	laboratory assay
hemolytic jaundice	is treated with	phototherapy
perinatal jaundice	is treated with	phototherapy
phototherapy	uses	blue light
blue light	converts	bilirubin to water‑soluble isomers
water‑soluble isomers	are excreted by	kidneys
phototherapy	reduces	bilirubin level
bilirubin level	predicts	kernicterus risk
kernicterus risk	predicts	neurodevelopmental delay
neurodevelopmental delay	predicts	cognitive impairment
cognitive impairment	predicts	school difficulties
phototherapy	is contraindicated in	severe anemia
severe anemia	requires	blood transfusion
blood transfusion	is performed by	transfusion service
transfusion service	ensures	blood compatibility
blood compatibility	is verified by	crossmatch
crossmatch	uses	donor blood
donor blood	is screened for	hepatitis B
hepatitis B	is transmitted by	blood
blood	is stored in	blood bank
blood bank	follows	inventory management
inventory management	predicts	blood shortages
blood shortages	predict	delayed transfusion
delayed transfusion	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	predicts	hospital readmission
hospital readmission	is predicted by	early discharge
early discharge	is influenced by	length of stay
length of stay	is reduced by	phototherapy
phototherapy	is monitored by	bilirubin trend
bilirubin trend	is plotted by	graph
graph	is reviewed by	neonatologist
neonatologist	prescribes	phototherapy duration
phototherapy duration	is limited by	eye safety
eye safety	requires	eye protection
eye protection	reduces	photic injury
photoc injury	reduces	long‑term vision loss
long‑term vision loss	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	is measured by	QoL questionnaire
QoL questionnaire	is administered by	nurse
nurse	records	patient data
patient data	is stored in	EMR
EMR	supports	clinical decision support
clinical decision support	recommends	phototherapy protocol
phototherapy protocol	is based on	guidelines
guidelines	are updated by	professional society
professional society	publishes	consensus statement
consensus statement	informs	treatment algorithm
treatment algorithm	predicts	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	recurrence risk
recurrence risk	predicts	readmission
readmission	is associated with	socioeconomic status
socioeconomic status	predicts	health literacy
health literacy	predicts	medication adherence
medication adherence	predicts	disease control
disease control	predicts	mortality
mortality	is a key outcome in	clinical trials
clinical trials	use	randomization
randomization	reduces	selection bias
selection bias	improves	generalizability
generalizability	informs	population health
population health	guides	public health policy
public health policy	allocates	resources
resources	influence	hospital capacity
hospital capacity	affects	patient flow
patient flow	is measured by	bed occupancy
bed occupancy	predicts	infection risk
infection risk	predicts	morbidity
morbidity	predicts	length of stay
length of stay	predicts	cost
cost	predicts	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	predicts	access to care
