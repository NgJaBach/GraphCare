menorrhagia	is a	heavy menstrual bleeding
heavy menstrual bleeding	is treated with	tranexamic acid
tranexamic acid	is a	antifibrinolytic
antifibrinolytic	reduces	menstrual blood loss
fibroids	cause	pelvic pain
pelvic pain	is a	symptom of uterine fibroids
uterine fibroids	are associated with	infertility
infertility	is a	reproductive issue
reproductive issue	is treated with	assisted reproductive technology
assisted reproductive technology	includes	in vitro fertilization
in vitro fertilization	is a	fertility treatment
fibroids	can be treated with	myomectomy
myomectomy	is a	surgical removal
surgical removal	is performed via	laparoscopy
laparoscopy	is a	minimally invasive surgery
minimally invasive surgery	reduces	postoperative pain
postoperative pain	is managed with	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	are a	non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory
non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory	reduces	inflammation
fibroids	can be treated with	uterine artery embolization
uterine artery embolization	is a	interventional radiology procedure
interventional radiology procedure	uses	embolic agents
embolic agents	include	polyvinyl alcohol particles
polyvinyl alcohol particles	are a	embolic material
embolic material	occludes	uterine arteries
occlusion of uterine arteries	reduces	fibroid size
fibroid size	is measured by	MRI
MRI	is a	magnetic resonance imaging
magnetic resonance imaging	is used for	soft‑tissue contrast
soft‑tissue contrast	is important for	pelvic imaging
pelvic imaging	is performed for	diagnosis
diagnosis	is confirmed by	histopathology
histopathology	is performed on	excised tissue
excised tissue	is processed with	hematoxylin‑eosin staining
hematoxylin‑eosin staining	is a	routine stain
routine stain	reveals	cellular architecture
cellular architecture	indicates	benign nature
benign nature	excludes	sarcoma
sarcoma	is a	malignant tumor
malignant tumor	is treated with	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	includes	doxorubicin
doxorubicin	is a	anthracycline
anthracycline	is a	cytotoxic agent
cytotoxic agent	induces	DNA damage
DNA damage	triggers	apoptosis
apoptosis	leads to	tumor regression
tumor regression	improves	fertility outcomes
fertility outcomes	are monitored with	pregnancy rate
pregnancy rate	is influenced by	uterine environment
uterine environment	is altered by	fibroids
fibroids	increase	risk of miscarriage
miscarriage	is a	pregnancy complication
pregnancy complication	is managed with	obstetric care
obstetric care	includes	prenatal visits
prenatal visits	involve	blood pressure monitoring
blood pressure monitoring	detects	hypertension
hypertension	is a	risk factor for preeclampsia
preeclampsia	is treated with	magnesium sulfate
magnesium sulfate	is a	anticonvulsant
anticonvulsant	prevents	eclampsia
eclampsia	is a	severe pregnancy complication
severe pregnancy complication	requires	ICU admission
ICU admission	is associated with	increased mortality
increased mortality	is predicted by	APACHE II score
APACHE II score	is calculated from	vital signs
vital signs	include	heart rate
heart rate	is monitored by	telemetry
telemetry	records	arrhythmias
arrhythmias	are treated with	beta‑blockers
beta‑blockers	are a	cardiovascular drug
cardiovascular drug	reduces	heart rate
heart rate reduction	improves	cardiac output
cardiac output	is essential for	organ perfusion
organ perfusion	is measured by	lactate level
lactate level	is a	biomarker of hypoxia
hypoxia	leads to	organ failure
organ failure	is managed with	dialysis
dialysis	is a	renal replacement therapy
renal replacement therapy	requires	vascular access
vascular access	is created with	arteriovenous fistula
arteriovenous fistula	is a	surgical procedure
surgical procedure	is performed by	vascular surgeon
vascular surgeon	specializes in	vascular disease
vascular disease	includes	peripheral artery disease
peripheral artery disease	is diagnosed with	ankle‑brachial index
ankle‑brachial index	is a	diagnostic test
diagnostic test	is used for	vascular assessment
vascular assessment	informs	risk stratification
risk stratification	guides	anticoagulation therapy
anticoagulation therapy	includes	warfarin
warfarin	is a	vitamin K antagonist
