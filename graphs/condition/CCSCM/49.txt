diabetes mellitus	is a	metabolic disorder
diabetes mellitus	causes	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	leads to	glucosuria
glucosuria	indicates	kidney filtration
diabetes mellitus	is diagnosed by	HbA1c
HbA1c	measures	average glucose
average glucose	reflects	glycemic control
glycemic control	predicts	microvascular risk
microvascular risk	includes	retinopathy
microvascular risk	includes	nephropathy
microvascular risk	includes	neuropathy
diabetes mellitus	increases	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	leads to	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	causes	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	results in	mortality
diabetes mellitus	is treated with	metformin
metformin	is a	biguanide
biguanide	reduces	hepatic gluconeogenesis
hepatic gluconeogenesis	lowers	fasting glucose
diabetes mellitus	is treated with	sulfonylureas
sulfonylureas	stimulate	insulin secretion
insulin secretion	improves	postprandial glucose
postprandial glucose	affects	glycemic variability
glycemic variability	predicts	hypoglycemia
hypoglycemia	causes	seizures
diabetes mellitus	is treated with	insulin
insulin	is a	peptide hormone
peptide hormone	binds	insulin receptor
insulin receptor	activates	PI3K pathway
PI3K pathway	promotes	glucose uptake
glucose uptake	occurs in	muscle
muscle	stores	glycogen
glycogen	is synthesized by	glycogen synthase
glycogen synthase	is activated by	insulin
diabetes mellitus	is associated with	obesity
obesity	increases	insulin resistance
insulin resistance	reduces	glucose uptake
glucose uptake	is measured by	glucose tolerance test
glucose tolerance test	predicts	type 2 diabetes
type 2 diabetes	is a	chronic disease
chronic disease	requires	lifestyle modification
lifestyle modification	includes	diet
diet	reduces	caloric intake
caloric intake	lowers	weight
weight	decreases	insulin resistance
diabetes mellitus	is linked to	hypertension
hypertension	causes	stroke
stroke	leads to	disability
diabetes mellitus	is linked to	dyslipidemia
dyslipidemia	includes	high LDL
high LDL	promotes	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	results in	peripheral artery disease
peripheral artery disease	causes	claudication
claudication	indicates	reduced blood flow
reduced blood flow	leads to	ulceration
ulceration	requires	wound care
wound care	involves	debridement
debridement	improves	healing
healing	is delayed by	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	impairs	immune function
immune function	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	increases	sepsis
sepsis	predicts	mortality
diabetes mellitus	is monitored by	fasting glucose
fasting glucose	is measured in	clinic
clinic	provides	patient education
patient education	improves	adherence
adherence	reduces	complications
complications	include	foot ulcers
foot ulcers	require	amputation
amputation	leads to	loss of ambulation
loss of ambulation	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	is assessed by	SF-36
SF-36	scores	physical component
physical component	correlates with	mobility
mobility	predicts	readmission
readmission	is a	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	is reduced by	telemedicine
telemedicine	enables	remote monitoring
remote monitoring	tracks	glucose levels
glucose levels	inform	medication adjustment
medication adjustment	improves	glycemic control
glycemic control	lowers	hypoglycemia episodes
hypoglycemia episodes	decrease	emergency visits
emergency visits	reduce	hospital stays
hospital stays	shorten	length of stay
length of stay	is a	readmission predictor
readmission predictor	informs	discharge planning
discharge planning	includes	home health
home health	supports	self-management
self-management	increases	self-efficacy
self-efficacy	predicts	adherence
adherence	lowers	HbA1c
HbA1c	is a	prognostic marker
prognostic marker	guides	therapy choice
therapy choice	selects	drug class
drug class	determines	side effect profile
side effect profile	affects	patient preference
patient preference	influences	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	mortality
