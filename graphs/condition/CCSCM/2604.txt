fire	causes	burn
burn	results in	tissue damage
tissue damage	leads to	inflammation
inflammation	triggers	pain
pain	prompts	emergency care
emergency care	includes	wound cleaning
wound cleaning	requires	antiseptic
antiseptic	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	increases	sepsis probability
sepsis	predicts	mortality
mortality	is a key outcome
burn	classified by	depth
depth	determines	treatment plan
treatment plan	may include	debridement
debridement	improves	healing
healing	depends on	nutrition
nutrition	assessed by	albumin level
albumin level	correlates with	wound closure
wound closure	reduces	readmission
readmission	is a risk factor
fire	can cause	smoke inhalation
smoke inhalation	leads to	airway injury
airway injury	requires	intubation
intubation	increases	ICU stay
ICU stay	predicts	complications
complications	include	pneumonia
pneumonia	worsens	prognosis
prognosis	informs	discharge planning
discharge planning	involves	home care
home care	reduces	rehospitalization
rehospitalization	is a cost driver
cost driver	influences	insurance claims
insurance claims	reflect	resource utilization
resource utilization	guides	policy
policy	sets	reimbursement rates
reimbursement rates	affect	provider behavior
provider behavior	impacts	treatment choice
treatment choice	affects	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	measured by	quality metrics
quality metrics	used for	performance evaluation
performance evaluation	informs	credentialing
credentialing	determines	access to care
access to care	influences	health disparities
health disparities	drive	public health initiatives
public health initiatives	target	prevention
prevention	includes	fire safety education
fire safety education	reduces	burn incidence
burn incidence	lowers	emergency visits
emergency visits	decrease	healthcare burden
healthcare burden	mitigated by	telemedicine
telemedicine	supports	follow‑up care
follow‑up care	ensures	scar management
scar management	improves	cosmetic outcome
cosmetic outcome	enhances	quality of life
quality of life	measured by	SF‑36
SF‑36	predicts	functional status
functional status	determines	return to work
return to work	affects	socioeconomic status
socioeconomic status	correlates with	health literacy
health literacy	predicts	medication adherence
medication adherence	influences	infection control
infection control	reduces	antibiotic resistance
antibiotic resistance	increases	treatment cost
treatment cost	drives	cost‑effectiveness analysis
cost‑effectiveness analysis	informs	drug selection
drug selection	includes	topical antibiotics
topical antibiotics	used for	superficial burns
superficial burns	treated with	silver sulfadiazine
silver sulfadiazine	is a	antimicrobial
antimicrobial	prevents	colonization
colonization	leads to	biofilm formation
biofilm formation	hampers	wound healing
wound healing	monitored by	wound size
wound size	predicts	graft necessity
graft necessity	requires	skin graft
skin graft	sourced from	autograft
autograft	harvested from	donor site
donor site	heals by	secondary intention
secondary intention	takes	longer time
longer time	increases	caregiver burden
caregiver burden	measured by	Zarit index
Zarit index	correlates with	depression
depression	reduces	adherence
adherence	affects	recurrence
recurrence	leads to	readmission
readmission	triggers	quality improvement
quality improvement	uses	root cause analysis
root cause analysis	identifies	system gaps
system gaps	addressed by	protocol development
protocol development	standardizes	burn care
burn care	follows	Advanced Trauma Life Support
ATLS	includes	airway management
airway management	critical for	inhalation injury
inhalation injury	assessed by	bronchoscopy
bronchoscopy	guides	ventilator strategy
ventilator strategy	reduces	ventilator‑associated pneumonia
ventilator‑associated pneumonia	lowers	ICU mortality
ICU mortality	is a key metric
key metric	informs	benchmarking
benchmarking	drives	continuous improvement
