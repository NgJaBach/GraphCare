osteoporosis	is a	bone disease
osteoporosis	causes	bone loss
osteoporosis	increases	fracture risk
osteoporosis	is diagnosed by	DEXA scan
DEXA scan	measures	bone density
bone density	is expressed as	T‑score
T‑score	indicates	osteoporosis severity
osteoporosis	is common in	postmenopausal women
osteoporosis	is common in	elderly men
osteoporosis	is caused by	estrogen deficiency
estrogen deficiency	leads to	increased bone resorption
bone resorption	is mediated by	osteoclasts
osteoclasts	are activated by	RANK‑L
RANK‑L	is inhibited by	denosumab
denosumab	is a	monoclonal antibody
denosumab	reduces	fracture incidence
osteoporosis	is treated with	bisphosphonates
bisphosphonates	are a	class of drugs
bisphosphonates	include	alendronate
alendronate	is taken	orally
alendronate	reduces	bone turnover
bisphosphonates	include	zoledronic acid
zoledronic acid	is given	intravenously
zoledronic acid	improves	bone mineral density
osteoporosis	is treated with	selective estrogen receptor modulators
SERMs	include	raloxifene
raloxifene	reduces	vertebral fractures
osteoporosis	is treated with	parathyroid hormone
parathyroid hormone	includes	teriparatide
teriparatide	stimulates	bone formation
osteoporosis	is treated with	calcitonin
calcitonin	is a	hormone
osteoporosis	is treated with	vitamin D
vitamin D	is required for	calcium absorption
vitamin D	is measured by	serum 25‑OH‑D
serum 25‑OH‑D	indicates	vitamin D status
vitamin D	is supplemented with	cholecalciferol
cholecalciferol	is vitamin D3
osteoporosis	is treated with	calcium
calcium	is a	mineral
calcium	is absorbed in	small intestine
osteoporosis	is associated with	low body mass index
low BMI	predicts	fracture risk
osteoporosis	is associated with	smoking
smoking	increases	bone loss
osteoporosis	is associated with	alcohol use
alcohol use	impairs	bone formation
osteoporosis	is associated with	corticosteroid use
corticosteroids	cause	secondary osteoporosis
secondary osteoporosis	is caused by	chronic disease
osteoporosis	is associated with	rheumatoid arthritis
rheumatoid arthritis	is treated with	methotrexate
methotrexate	can cause	bone toxicity
osteoporosis	is associated with	chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease	reduces	vitamin D activation
osteoporosis	is associated with	malabsorption syndromes
malabsorption	reduces	calcium absorption
osteoporosis	is associated with	hypogonadism
hypogonadism	leads to	decreased estrogen
osteoporosis	is associated with	thyroid disorders
hyperthyroidism	increases	bone turnover
osteoporosis	is associated with	diabetes mellitus
diabetes	impairs	bone quality
osteoporosis	is associated with	chronic inflammation
chronic inflammation	increases	cytokine production
cytokines	stimulate	osteoclast activity
osteoporosis	is associated with	low vitamin K
vitamin K	is required for	osteocalcin carboxylation
osteocalcin	is a	bone matrix protein
osteoporosis	is associated with	sedentary lifestyle
sedentary lifestyle	reduces	mechanical loading
mechanical loading	stimulates	bone formation
osteoporosis	is associated with	low protein intake
protein intake	supports	bone matrix
osteoporosis	is associated with	high sodium intake
high sodium	increases	calcium excretion
osteoporosis	is associated with	high caffeine intake
caffeine	reduces	calcium absorption
osteoporosis	is associated with	low vitamin C
vitamin C	is required for	collagen synthesis
collagen	is a	bone matrix component
osteoporosis	is associated with	low magnesium
magnesium	is required for	bone mineralization
osteoporosis	is associated with	low zinc
zinc	is required for	bone growth
osteoporosis	is associated with	low selenium
selenium	is an	antioxidant
osteoporosis	is associated with	low omega‑3
omega‑3	reduces	inflammation
osteoporosis	is associated with	high cortisol
cortisol	increases	bone resorption
osteoporosis	is associated with	low physical activity
physical activity	reduces	fracture risk
osteoporosis	is associated with	low balance
low balance	increases	fall risk
fall risk	increases	fracture risk
osteoporosis	is treated with	exercise
exercise	includes	weight‑bearing
weight‑bearing	improves	bone density
osteoporosis	is monitored by	repeat DEXA
