ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	requires	perineal repair
perineal repair	is performed with	sutures
suturing	reduces	pain
suturing	reduces	infection
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is classified by	degree of laceration
degree of laceration	determines	treatment plan
treatment plan	may include	physiotherapy
physiotherapy	improves	pelvic floor strength
pelvic floor strength	reduces	incontinence
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	episiotomy
episiotomy	is performed to	prevent severe laceration
episiotomy	increases risk of	infection
episiotomy	increases risk of	pain
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	forceps delivery
forceps delivery	increases risk of	perineal trauma
forceps delivery	increases risk of	uterine injury
uterine injury	requires	surgical repair
surgical repair	may involve	hysterectomy
hysterectomy	eliminates	future pregnancy
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	prolonged labor
prolonged labor	increases risk of	fetal distress
fetal distress	requires	emergency cesarean
emergency cesarean	increases risk of	surgical complications
surgical complications	include	hemorrhage
hemorrhage	requires	blood transfusion
blood transfusion	increases risk of	transfusion reactions
transfusion reactions	require	monitoring
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	maternal anemia
maternal anemia	requires	iron supplementation
iron supplementation	improves	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	reduces	fatigue
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	postpartum depression
postpartum depression	requires	counseling
counseling	improves	mood
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	breastfeeding difficulties
breastfeeding difficulties	require	lactation support
lactation support	improves	milk supply
milk supply	reduces	infant growth issues
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	scar tissue formation
scar tissue formation	leads to	dyspareunia
dyspareunia	requires	pain management
pain management	includes	topical anesthetic
topical anesthetic	reduces	pain
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	infection risk
infection risk	requires	antibiotics
antibiotics	reduce	infection
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	wound dehiscence
wound dehiscence	requires	re‑suture
re‑suture	increases	healing time
healing time	is prolonged by	smoking
smoking	increases	infection risk
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	obesity
obesity	increases	perineal pressure
perineal pressure	increases	trauma risk
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	diabetes
diabetes	impairs	wound healing
wound healing	is delayed by	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	requires	glucose control
glucose control	achieved with	insulin
insulin	reduces	complications
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	age
age	influences	tissue elasticity
tissue elasticity	affects	healing
healing	is faster in	younger patients
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	parity
parity	increases	cumulative tissue damage
cumulative tissue damage	increases	recurrence risk
recurrence risk	requires	preventive measures
preventive measures	include	pelvic floor exercises
pelvic floor exercises	reduce	recurrence
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	delivery position
delivery position	influences	laceration severity
laceration severity	determines	anesthesia type
anesthesia type	can be	epidural
epidural	reduces	pain
pain	is monitored by	pain score
pain score	guides	analgesic dosing
analgesic dosing	aims to	maintain comfort
comfort	improves	recovery
recovery	is faster with	early mobilization
early mobilization	reduces	thromboembolism
thromboembolism	prevented by	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	reduce	clot risk
clot risk	is higher in	immobilized patients
ob‑related trauma to perineum and vulva	is associated with	postpartum hemorrhage
postpartum hemorrhage	requires	uterotonics
uterotonics	include	oxytocin
oxytocin	reduces	bleeding
bleeding	reduces	anemia
anemia	improves	energy
energy	supports	healing
healing	is monitored by	ultrasound
ultrasound	detects	fluid collection
