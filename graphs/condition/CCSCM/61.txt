exchange transfusion	used for	acute chest syndrome
acute chest syndrome	is a	life-threatening complication
acute chest syndrome	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	used for	acute chest syndrome
bone marrow transplantation	can be	curative for sickle cell anemia
bone marrow transplantation	limited by	donor availability
crizanlizumab	reduces	vaso-occlusive crises frequency
voxelotor	increases	hemoglobin concentration

parvovirus B19 infection	triggers	aplastic crisis
aplastic crisis	caused by	parvovirus B19
splenic infarction	occurs in	young sickle cell patients
splenic infarction	leads to	functional asplenia
hydration therapy	reduces	crisis risk
infection	increases	hospitalization risk
pediatric stroke	risk elevated by	sickle cell anemia
blood transfusion	used for	acute management of crisis
brain MRI	detects	cerebral vasculopathy
cerebral vasculopathy	detected by	transcranial Doppler
transcranial Doppler	screens for	stroke risk in children with sickle cell anemia
iron overload	results from	chronic transfusion therapy
iron chelation	treats	iron overload
chelation therapy	used for	iron overload
analgesia	used for	vaso-occlusive crisis
opioid analgesia	manages	severe pain
pain crisis	leads to	emergency department visit
emergency department visit	increases	healthcare costs
readmission	risk increased by	dehydration after crisis
