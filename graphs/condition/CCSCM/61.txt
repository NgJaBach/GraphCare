sickle cell anemia	is a	hemoglobinopathy
sickle cell anemia	is caused by	point mutation
point mutation	occurs in	β‑globin gene
β‑globin gene	is part of	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	carries	oxygen
sickle cell anemia	causes	hemoglobin S
hemoglobin S	polymerizes under	low oxygen
polymerization	leads to	red cell sickling
red cell sickling	causes	vaso‑occlusion
vaso‑occlusion	results in	ischemic pain
ischemic pain	manifests as	vaso‑occlusive crisis
vaso‑occlusive crisis	treated with	opioid analgesics
opioid analgesics	are a	pain medication
vaso‑occlusive crisis	can cause	acute chest syndrome
acute chest syndrome	is a	pulmonary complication
pulmonary complication	increases	mortality risk
sickle cell anemia	predisposes to	stroke
stroke	is a	cerebrovascular event
cerebrovascular event	requires	rapid intervention
rapid intervention	includes	thrombolytics
thrombolytics	are a	clot‑dissolving drug
sickle cell anemia	leads to	chronic hemolysis
chronic hemolysis	causes	anemia
anemia	results in	fatigue
fatigue	is a	symptom
sickle cell anemia	increases	infection risk
infection risk	is mitigated by	vaccinations
vaccinations	include	pneumococcal vaccine
pneumococcal vaccine	prevents	pneumonia
pneumonia	is a	respiratory infection
respiratory infection	can worsen	sickle cell anemia
sickle cell anemia	is screened by	newborn screening
newborn screening	detects	hemoglobinopathy
hemoglobinopathy	is monitored by	hemoglobin electrophoresis
hemoglobin electrophoresis	measures	hemoglobin variants
hemoglobin variants	include	hemoglobin S
hemoglobin S	is detected by	sickle cell test
sickle cell test	is a	diagnostic test
diagnostic test	informs	treatment plan
treatment plan	may include	hydroxyurea
hydroxyurea	is a	disease‑modifying drug
disease‑modifying drug	reduces	vaso‑occlusive crises
vaso‑occlusive crises	decrease	hospital readmissions
hospital readmissions	are a	quality metric
quality metric	influences	reimbursement
reimbursement	is affected by	readmission rates
readmission rates	are predicted by	risk score
risk score	uses	clinical variables
clinical variables	include	age
clinical variables	include	baseline hemoglobin
clinical variables	include	prior crises
clinical variables	include	infection history
clinical variables	include	hydroxyurea use
sickle cell anemia	can cause	leg ulcers
leg ulcers	are a	chronic wound
chronic wound	requires	wound care
wound care	may involve	debridement
debridement	is performed by	surgeon
surgeon	is a	specialist
specialist	may be	hematologist
hematologist	manages	sickle cell anemia
sickle cell anemia	may lead to	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary hypertension	is a	cardiovascular complication
cardiovascular complication	is treated with	endothelin receptor antagonists
endothelin receptor antagonists	are a	drug class
drug class	reduces	pulmonary pressures
pulmonary pressures	lower	mortality
sickle cell anemia	is associated with	iron overload
iron overload	results from	transfusions
transfusions	are given for	severe anemia
severe anemia	requires	blood transfusion
blood transfusion	can cause	alloimmunization
alloimmunization	complicates	future transfusions
future transfusions	may need	cross‑matching
cross‑matching	is a	laboratory procedure
laboratory procedure	informs	transfusion safety
transfusion safety	improves	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	include	survival
survival	is a	mortality metric
mortality metric	is used for	risk stratification
risk stratification	guides	therapy intensity
therapy intensity	may involve	stem cell transplant
stem cell transplant	is a	curative option
curative option	requires	matched donor
matched donor	is identified by	HLA typing
HLA typing	is a	genetic test
genetic test	informs	transplant eligibility
transplant eligibility	determines	treatment pathway
treatment pathway	includes	conditioning regimen
conditioning regimen	uses	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	is a	cytotoxic agent
cytotoxic agent	can cause	immunosuppression
immunosuppression	increases	infection risk
infection risk	is monitored by	prophylaxis
prophylaxis	includes	trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole
trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole	is a	antibiotic
antibiotic	prevents	Pneumocystis jirovecii
Pneumocystis jirovecii	causes	opportunistic infection
opportunistic infection	worsens	prognosis
prognosis	is predicted by	clinical score
