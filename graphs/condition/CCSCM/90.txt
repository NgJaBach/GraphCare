swelling	is a	sign of	inflammation
discharge	is a	sign of	infection
fever	is a	sign of	infection
photophobia	is a	sign of	infection
inflammation	is treated with	corticosteroids
infection	is treated with	antibiotics
corticosteroids	are a	drug class
antibiotics	are a	drug class
corticosteroids	reduce	inflammation
antibiotics	kill	bacteria
antibiotics	inhibit	viral replication
bacteria	cause	bacterial infection
virus	cause	viral infection
bacterial infection	causes	keratitis
viral infection	causes	keratitis
keratitis	is a	corneal inflammation
keratitis	leads to	vision loss
vision loss	is a	complication of	keratitis
keratitis	is diagnosed with	slit lamp exam
slit lamp exam	is a	diagnostic tool
slit lamp exam	detects	corneal lesions
corneal lesions	are a	sign of	keratitis
keratitis	is classified as	acute
keratitis	is classified as	chronic
acute keratitis	is treated with	topical antibiotics
chronic keratitis	is treated with	systemic therapy
topical antibiotics	are a	eye drop
systemic therapy	includes	oral steroids
oral steroids	are a	systemic corticosteroid
eye drop	is a	medication form
eye drop	delivers	drug
drug	reduces	inflammation
drug	kills	bacteria
drug	inhibits	viral replication
infection	can be	bacterial
infection	can be	viral
infection	can be	fungal
fungal infection	causes	keratitis
fungal infection	is treated with	antifungals
antifungals	are a	drug class
antifungals	kill	fungi
fungi	cause	fungal infection
fungal infection	leads to	corneal scarring
corneal scarring	leads to	vision impairment
vision impairment	is a	risk factor for	blindness
blindness	is a	severe outcome
infection	can spread to	uvea
uveitis	is a	uveal inflammation
uveitis	leads to	cataract
cataract	is a	lens opacity
lens opacity	leads to	vision loss
vision loss	is a	predictor of	mortality
mortality	is a	healthcare outcome
mortality	is influenced by	infection severity
infection severity	is measured by	clinical score
clinical score	predicts	readmission
readmission	is a	healthcare utilization
readmission	is predicted by	comorbidity
comorbidity	includes	diabetes
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	increases	with	age
age	is a	risk factor for	infection
infection	is associated with	hospitalization
hospitalization	is a	predictor of	mortality
mortality	is reduced by	early treatment
early treatment	is facilitated by	telemedicine
telemedicine	reduces	time to treatment
time to treatment	reduces	complications
complications	include	vision loss
vision loss	is a	predictor of	depression
depression	is a	comorbidity
comorbidity	increases	readmission
readmission	increases	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	is a	burden
burden	is mitigated by	preventive care
preventive care	includes	vaccination
vaccination	reduces	infection incidence
